# Introduction

## Motivation

Most popular UI component libraries are designed to work with a specific JavaScript framework. Building UI components
that work across different JavaScript frameworks presents significant challenges for organizations working with diverse
technology stacks.

## Solution

Ark UI provides components for building complex, interactive, and accessible user interfaces across multiple JavaScript
frameworks. To achieve this, Ark UI is built on top of [Zag.js](https://zagjs.com), a UI component library powered by
Finite State Machines. Check out the architecture diagram below for a high-level overview.

# Getting Started

## Quickstart

Running tight on schedule? No worries! Check out our quickstart examples to get started with Ark UI in seconds.

- [Next.js Template](https://stackblitz.com/edit/github-qcm2dskf)
- [Solid Start Template](https://stackblitz.com/edit/github-1hgkbbln)
- [Nuxt Template](https://stackblitz.com/edit/github-s3sg6syq)

## Setup Guide

<Steps>
<Step title="Prerequisite" number="1">

Before you start, ensure you have a proper project setup. If not, follow your preferred application framework setup
guide and then return to this guide.

</Step>
<Step title="Install Ark UI" number="2">

Install the Ark UI dependency using your preferred package manager.

```bash
npm install @ark-ui/solid
// or
pnpm install @ark-ui/solid
// or
yarn add @ark-ui/solid
// or
bun add @ark-ui/solid
```

</Step>
<Step number="3" title="Add a component">

In this guide, we will be adding a Slider component. Copy the following code to your project.

```tsx
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/solid/slider'

export const Basic = () => {
  return (
    <Slider.Root>
      <Slider.Label>Label</Slider.Label>
      <Slider.ValueText />
      <Slider.Control>
        <Slider.Track>
          <Slider.Range />
        </Slider.Track>
        <Slider.Thumb index={0}>
          <Slider.HiddenInput />
        </Slider.Thumb>
      </Slider.Control>
    </Slider.Root>
  )
}
```

</Step>

<Step number="4" title="Style a component">
Ark UI is a headless component library that doesn't include default styles.
You can leverage the `data-scope` and `data-part` attributes to style your components with custom CSS.

For example, to style a slider component, you can target its parts using these attributes:

```css
/* Targets the <Slider.Root /> */
[data-scope='slider'][data-part='root'] {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

Check out the [Styling Components guide](/react/docs/guides/styling) to learn more about styling components in Ark UI.

</Step>

<Step number="5" title="That's it">

Congratulations! You've successfully set up and styled your components using Ark UI. If you run into any issues or have
questions, open an issue on our [GitHub](https://github.com/chakra-ui/ark/issues/new/choose) or reach out on
[Discord](https://discord.gg/ww6HE5xaZ2).

Happy hacking! ✌️

# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Marquee** [New]: Initial release of marquee component for continuously scrolling content

### Fixed

- **Angle Slider**: Resolved an issue where dragging the thumb from non-center positions caused unexpected value jumps.
  The thumb now maintains consistent positioning relative to the initial click point.

- **Slider**: Fixed a problem where the thumb offset shifted dynamically during dragging, resulting in value jumps. The
  offset now remains constant from the pointer throughout the drag operation.

## [5.26.2] - 2025-10-18

### Fixed

- **Angle Slider**: Fix accessibility violation where the slider thumb element lacked an accessible name. The thumb now
  supports `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby` props, and automatically falls back to the label element's ID for proper
  ARIA labeling.

- **Select**: Fix accessibility violation where the required state was not set correctly to on the trigger.

- **Tags Input**: Fix issue where entering a custom tag with combobox integration required pressing `Enter` twice. The
  tags-input now correctly handles custom values when the combobox has no highlighted item (`aria-activedescendant` is
  empty), allowing the tag to be added on the first `Enter` press.

## [5.26.1] - 2025-10-15

### Fixed

- **Checkbox**
  - Fix issue where setting initial checked state to `indeterminate` doesn't work
  - Ensure `api.checkedState` returns the correct checked state (`boolean | "indeterminate"`)

- **Collapsible**: Fix issue where `dir` prop value was hardcoded to `ltr` instead of using the provided value

- **Combobox**: Fix issue where controlled single-select combobox does not propagate its initial value to `inputValue`

- **Listbox**: Fix issue where pressing Enter key when no highlighted item still calls `event.preventDefault()`

- **Radio Group**: Refactor to use `getBoundingClientRect()` for precise indicator positioning

- **Slider**
  - Fix issue where slider could stop abruptly when scrubbing thumb
  - Fix issue where range slider thumbs become stuck when dragged to the same position without `minStepsBetweenThumbs`

- **Tabs**: Refactor to use `getBoundingClientRect()` for precise indicator positioning

- **Tags Input**: Fix issue where `maxLength` doesn't apply to the edit input as well

## [5.26.0] - 2025-10-08

### Added

- **Collapsible**: Add support for `collapsedHeight` and `collapsedWidth` props to control the dimensions of the
  collapsible content when in its collapsed state.

- **Focus Trap**: Allow elements referenced by `aria-controls` to be included in the trap scope. This makes it possible
  for menus, popovers, etc. to be portalled and work correctly.

- **Pagination**: Add `getPageUrl` prop for generating `href` attributes when using pagination as links.

```ts
const service = useMachine(pagination.machine, {
  type: 'link',
  getPageUrl: ({ page, pageSize }) => `/products?page=${page}&size=${pageSize}`,
})
```

- **Select**: Add `SelectRootComponentProps` type export for better component type composition.

- **Listbox**: Add `ListboxRootComponentProps` type export for better component type composition.

- **Combobox**: Add `ComboboxRootComponentProps` type export for better component type composition.

- **TreeView**:
  - Add `TreeViewRootComponentProps` type export for better component type composition.
  - (Experimental) Add support for node renaming functionality:
    - Add `TreeViewNodeRenameInput` component for inline node label editing
    - Add `canRename` prop to control which nodes can be renamed
    - Add `onRenameStart`, `onBeforeRename`, and `onRenameComplete` callbacks for rename lifecycle
    - Add `CheckedChangeDetails`, `LoadChildrenErrorDetails`, `RenameStartDetails`, and `RenameCompleteDetails` type
      exports

### Fixed

- **Scroll Area**: Fix RTL horizontal scrollbar positioning on Safari

- **Slider**: Fix issue where slider continues dragging when disabled during drag operation.

- **Switch**: Fix issue where `data-active` is inconsistently applied when `disabled` state changes at runtime

## [5.25.1] - 2025-09-27

### Fixed

- **Date Picker**
  - Fix issue where year range picker doesn't show the hovered range
  - Fix issue where quarter presets returns incorrect date

- **FormatByte**: Add support for `unitSystem` property to allow changing between decimal (1000 bytes) and binary (1024
  bytes) systems.

- **Number Input**: When `formatOptions` is used (like `style: "currency"`), the cursor would jump to the end of the
  input when typing in the middle. The cursor now maintains its relative position during formatting changes.

- **Pin Input**: Fix issue where using the keyboard shortcuts `Cmd+Backspace` and `Cmd+Delete` to delete text in pin
  inputs would insert "undefined" instead of clearing the field.

- **Scroll Area**: Fix issue where resize tracking was not observing the root element, which caused the scrollbar to not
  update when the root element's size changed.

## [5.25.0] - 2025-09-16

### Added

- Added `mergeProps` utility for combining multiple props objects with proper event handler and className merging.
- Added `createContext` utility for creating typed React contexts with improved DX.

```tsx
import { createContext } from '@ark-ui/react/utils'
```

### Fixed

- **AngleSlider**: Export `angleSliderAnatomy` from the anatomy exports

## [5.24.1] - 2025-09-14

### Fixed

- **General**: Fix issue where `mergeProps` throws when `props` is `undefined` or `null`

## [5.24.0] - 2025-09-14

### Added

- **Combobox**: Add `alwaysSubmitOnEnter` prop to allow bypassing the default two-step behavior (Enter to close
  combobox, then Enter to submit form) and instead submit the form immediately on Enter press. This is useful for
  single-field autocomplete forms where Enter should submit the form directly.

- **Dismissable**: Add support for layer types in dismissable layer stack. Layers can now be categorized as `dialog`,
  `popover`, `menu`, or `listbox`. This enables:
  - `data-nested` attribute on nested layers of the same type
  - `data-has-nested` attribute on parent layers with nested children of the same type
  - `--nested-layer-count` CSS variable indicating the number of nested layers of the same type

### Changed

- **Hover Card**: Change default delay values for hover card to improve accessibility.
  - `openDelay`: from `700ms` to `600ms`

- **Tooltip**: Change default delay values for tooltip to improve accessibility.
  [Learn more](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/timing-exposing-content)
  - `openDelay`: from `1000ms` to `400ms`
  - `closeDelay`: from `500ms` to `150ms`

### Removed

- **TimePicker**: The TimePicker component has been removed from this release. This component was never part of the
  public API and was considered experimental. It had significant bugs and usability issues across all frameworks and
  locales, making it unsuitable for production use.

  **Migration**: We recommend building a custom time picker using the Select component for simple use cases, or
  implementing a time grid pattern for more complex scenarios.

### Fixed

- **Editable**: Allow text selection in editable preview when `autoResize` is enabled

  Previously, when `autoResize` was set to `true`, the preview element had `userSelect: "none"` applied, preventing
  users from selecting text. This has been fixed by removing the `userSelect` style property.

- **File Upload**: Fix regression where clicking the trigger doesn't open the file picker when used within the dropzone

- **Menu**:
  - Fix issue where keyboard activation of menu items with `target="_blank"` would open two tabs
  - Fix issue where hovering a partially visible item with pointer causes it to scroll into view

- **Tabs**: Fix issue where `ids` for `item` and `content` could not be customized

- **Toast**: Allow creating a toast store without any arguments

## [5.23.0] - 2025-09-08

### Added

- **Field**: Add `data-required` attribute to `Field.Label`
- **Select, Combobox, Listbox, TreeView**: Export `RootComponent` and `RootProviderComponent` types which are useful
  when building compositions that wrap the `Root` and `RootProvider` components and you still want type-safety for the
  collection.

### Fixed

- **Menu**: Fix `Menu.ItemText` not working inside `Menu.TriggerItem`

  ```tsx
  import { Select } from '@ark-ui/react/select'
  import { styled } from 'styling-lib'

  const Root = styled(Select.Root) as Select.RootComponent<{}>
  ```

## [5.22.0] - 2025-08-28

### Added

- **Combobox**: Add `ComboboxEmpty` component to display content when the combobox has no items

- **Listbox**: Add `ListboxEmpty` component to display content when the listbox has no items

- **Hover Card**: Add support for `disabled` prop

### Fixed

- **Collection**: Fix issue where disabled items could be reached via typeahead

- **Color Picker**: Fix issue where color picker was not working correctly in RTL mode

- **Date Picker**: Fix issue where datepicker doesn't revert to a valid value when the input value exceeds the min/max
  and blurred

- **Dismissable**: Expose `onRequestDismiss` custom event handler for event a parent layer requests the child layer to
  dismiss. If prevented via `event.preventDefault()`, the child layer will not dismiss when the parent layer is
  dismissed.

- **Number Input**
  - Omit the input `pattern` when `formatOptions` is provided. This prevents native pattern validation from conflicting
    with formatted values (e.g., currency or percent).
  - Handle empty values consistently across all format options.
  - Add `data-scrubbing` attribute to the number input parts.

- **Tags Input**: Fix issue where highlighted item doesn't clear when tabbing out of the input to an external button
  within the `control` part.

- **Tooltip**
  - Set `closeOnPointerdown` to `false` when `closeOnClick` is set to `false`
  - Reduce bundle size by replacing `@zag-js/store` dependency with a lightweight store implementation.

## [5.21.0] - 2025-08-24

### Added

- **Hooks**: Add `useAsyncList` and `useCollator` hooks for managing asynchronous list operations and locale-aware
  string comparison
- **Toast**: Export type definitions `ToastActionOptions`, `ToastPlacement`, `ToastPromiseOptions`, `ToastStatus`,
  `ToastStatusChangeDetails`, and `ToastType`

### Changed

- **Fieldset**
  - Update Legend component to render as `div` instead of `legend` element for improved styling flexibility
  - Add `aria-labelledby` attribute to fieldset root for better accessibility by linking to legend

### Fixed

- **Date Picker**
  - Clear hovered range state after completing range selection instead of waiting for pointer to leave the calendar
    area.
  - Fix issue where month and year select labels don't update correctly when using `min`/`max` constraints.
  - Expose `disabled` on `api.getMonths()` and `api.getYears()` results to indicate options out of range for current
    constraints.

- **Listbox**
  - Fix issue where first enabled item should be highlighted by default when listbox receives focus and no item is
    currently highlighted.
  - Add `getElement` to `scrollToIndexFn` details
  - Track collection changes and clear `highlightedValue` if the item is no longer in the collection.

- **Scroll Area**
  - Avoid detecting hover state from portalled descendants.
  - Add `data-dragging` attribute to scroll area parts.

- **Select**: Add `getElement` to `scrollToIndexFn` details

- **Combobox**: Add `getElement` to `scrollToIndexFn` details

- **Tabs**: Fix inconsistent keyboard navigation where TabPanel intermittently receives focus before focusable elements

## [5.20.0] - 2025-08-20

### Added

## [5.19.0] - 2025-08-18

### Added

- **ScrollArea [NEW]**: Add support for new scroll area component.

### Fixed

- **ListCollection**
  - Avoid recomputing groups on every call to `at()` and `indexOf()`
  - Fixed bug in `find()` method (was checking `!= null` instead of `!== -1`)

- **GridCollection**: Avoid recomputing rows on every call to `getRows()`

- **Menu**
  - Add `data-state` attribute for context menu trigger
  - Fix context menu positioning bug where reopening at the same coordinates fails to reposition

## [5.18.4] - 2025-08-14

### Fixed

- **Listbox**: Add support for navigating grid collections

- **Carousel**:
  - Fix an issue where the carousel would not update when `slideCount` or `autoplay` props change.
  - Fix an issue where `loop: false` was ignored when using autoplay. Now, the carousel will stop when it gets to the
    last slide.

- **Date Picker**: Expose `data-inline` attribute on Content part to enable distinct styling for inline date pickers
  versus popover date pickers.

- **Menu**: Fix issue where `onCheckedChange` could be called twice on checkbox or radio item

- **Radio Group**: Fixed issue where arrow key navigation doesn't apply `data-focus-visible` on the newly focused item.

- **TagsInput**: Export `InputValueChangeDetails` type

### Changed

- **Async List**: Improve type inference for descriptors

## [5.18.3] - 2025-08-01

### Fixed

## [5.18.2] - 2025-07-26

### Fixed

- **Dialog**
  - Sync content `--layer-index` with positioner and backdrop

## [5.18.1] - 2025-07-23

### Fixed

- **Date Picker**: Fixed issue where hovered range was connect to selected values, when it shouldn't

- **Tree View**: Fixed issue where tree view doesn't scroll into view when content overflows.

## [5.18.0] - 2025-07-22

### Added

- **Collection**: Add `useListSelection` hook for managing collection item selection with support for single/multiple
  selection modes

  ```jsx
  const collection = createListCollection({ items: ['React', 'Vue', 'Angular'] })
  const selection = useListSelection({ collection })

  // Check if item is selected
  const isSelected = selection.isSelected('React')

  // Select/deselect items
  selection.select('React')
  selection.toggle('Vue')
  ```

- **File Upload**: Add support for programmatically controlling the accepted files via `acceptedFiles` and
  `defaultAcceptedFiles`

- **Signature Pad**: Add support for programmatically controlling the paths via `paths` and `defaultPaths` props.

- **Date Picker**: Added hover range preview support for date picker range selection. Added `inHoveredRange`,
  `firstInHoveredRange`, and `lastInHoveredRange` properties to `DayTableCellState` with corresponding data attributes
  `data-in-hover-range`, `data-hover-range-start`, and `data-hover-range-end`.

  Hover range states are only active when not overlapping with actual selected range, enabling distinct styling for
  hover preview vs actual selection in range mode.

### Fixed

- **Date Picker**: Fix date comparison issues when time components are involved. This resolves critical issues with date
  comparison operations when different date types (`CalendarDate`, `CalendarDateTime`, `ZonedDateTime`) are mixed,
  particularly in scenarios involving time components.

- **File Upload**
  - Export `FileError`, `FileMimeType`, and `FileRejection` types
  - Fix issue where calling `api.setFiles` invokes validation with incorrect `acceptedFiles`
  - Fix issue where the browser might not be able to infer the mime type of a file due to limitations, drag source or
    security restrictions. As a fallback in the file validation logic, we now infer the mime type from the file
    extension.

## [5.16.1] - 2025-07-05

### Fixed

- **Combobox**
  - Expose `reason` to `onOpenChange` and `onInputValueChange` callbacks

- **Tree View**: Exported `TreeViewNodeState` and `TreeViewNodeProps` types from `@zag-js/tree-view`

### Changed

- **Collection**: Improve the APIs around `tree.flatten(...)` and `flattenedToTree` to ensure the original node
  properties are preserved.

  > Previously, `tree.flatten()` would return an array of objects with `value` and `label` stripping out the original
  > node properties.

  ```ts
  const tree = new TreeCollection({
    rootNode: {
      value: 'ROOT',
      children: [{ value: 'child1' }, { value: 'child2' }],
    },
  })

  const flattened = tree.flatten()
  const reconstructed = flattenedToTree(flattened)

  console.log(reconstructed.rootNode)

  // {
  //   value: "ROOT",
  //   children: [{ value: "child1" }, { value: "child2" }],
  // }

  - `loadChildren` is a function that is used to load the children of a node.
  - `onLoadChildrenComplete` is a callback that is called when the children of a node are loaded. Used to update the
    tree collection.
  - Add `childrenCount` to the node object to indicate the number of children.

### Fixed

- **Slider**
  - Fixed issue where `Shift` + `ArrowRight` set value to `0` instead of `max` when step is too large (e.g. `20`)

    <PasswordInput.Control>
      <PasswordInput.Input />
      <PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger>
        <PasswordInput.Indicator fallback={<EyeOffIcon />}>
          <EyeIcon />

    </PasswordInput.Control>
  </PasswordInput.Root>
)
```

- **Select**: Added `onSelect` callback that gets fired when an item is selected via keyboard/mouse.

### Fixed

- **Color Picker**: Fixed issue where value change end event is invoked when committing via an input.

## [5.0.0] - 2025-03-06

Ark UI just got a major performance boost! 🚀

### What’s new in v5?

- **Blazing-fast performance** – Every component runs smoother and renders faster.
- **Smaller bundle size** – Leaner components and adapters for a more efficient build.

We made this happen by using React’s native reactive primitives instead of external stores.

In our stress tests with **10,000 components**, Ark v5 delivered **1.5x–4x** better performance across the board.

![Performance comparison showing Ark v5 is 1.5x-4x faster than other libraries](./v5.svg)

### A quick note on tests

Most component updates are non-breaking, but due to this change, some tests may need adjustments. For example:

```jsx
// Before
it('should open by default', () => {
  render(<ComponentUnderTest defaultOpen />)
  expect(screen.getByRole('dialog')).toBeInTheDocument()
})

// After
it('should open by default', async () => {
  render(<ComponentUnderTest defaultOpen />)
  expect(await screen.findByRole('dialog')).toBeInTheDocument()
})
```

# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Marquee** [New]: Initial release of marquee component for continuously scrolling content

### Fixed

- **Angle Slider**: Resolved an issue where dragging the thumb from non-center positions caused unexpected value jumps.
  The thumb now maintains consistent positioning relative to the initial click point.

- **Slider**: Fixed a problem where the thumb offset shifted dynamically during dragging, resulting in value jumps. The
  offset now remains constant from the pointer throughout the drag operation.

## [5.26.2] - 2025-10-18

### Fixed

- **Angle Slider**: Fix accessibility violation where the slider thumb element lacked an accessible name. The thumb now
  supports `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby` props, and automatically falls back to the label element's ID for proper
  ARIA labeling.

- **Select**: Fix accessibility violation where the required state was not set correctly to on the trigger.

- **Tags Input**: Fix issue where entering a custom tag with combobox integration required pressing `Enter` twice. The
  tags-input now correctly handles custom values when the combobox has no highlighted item (`aria-activedescendant` is
  empty), allowing the tag to be added on the first `Enter` press.

## [5.26.1] - 2025-10-15

### Fixed

- **Checkbox**
  - Fix issue where setting initial checked state to `indeterminate` doesn't work
  - Ensure `api.checkedState` returns the correct checked state (`boolean | "indeterminate"`)

- **Collapsible**: Fix issue where `dir` prop value was hardcoded to `ltr` instead of using the provided value

- **Combobox**: Fix issue where controlled single-select combobox does not propagate its initial value to `inputValue`

- **Listbox**: Fix issue where pressing Enter key when no highlighted item still calls `event.preventDefault()`

- **Radio Group**: Refactor to use `getBoundingClientRect()` for precise indicator positioning

- **Slider**
  - Fix issue where slider could stop abruptly when scrubbing thumb
  - Fix issue where range slider thumbs become stuck when dragged to the same position without `minStepsBetweenThumbs`

- **Tabs**: Refactor to use `getBoundingClientRect()` for precise indicator positioning

- **Tags Input**: Fix issue where `maxLength` doesn't apply to the edit input as well

## [5.26.0] - 2025-10-08

### Added

- **Collapsible**: Add support for `collapsedHeight` and `collapsedWidth` props to control the dimensions of the
  collapsible content when in its collapsed state.

- **Focus Trap**: Allow elements referenced by `aria-controls` to be included in the trap scope. This makes it possible
  for menus, popovers, etc. to be portalled and work correctly.

- **Pagination**: Add `getPageUrl` prop for generating `href` attributes when using pagination as links.

```ts
const service = useMachine(pagination.machine, {
  type: 'link',
  getPageUrl: ({ page, pageSize }) => `/products?page=${page}&size=${pageSize}`,
})
```

- **Select**: Add `SelectRootComponentProps` type export for better component type composition.

- **Listbox**: Add `ListboxRootComponentProps` type export for better component type composition.

- **Combobox**: Add `ComboboxRootComponentProps` type export for better component type composition.

- **TreeView**:
  - Add `TreeViewRootComponentProps` type export for better component type composition.
  - (Experimental) Add support for node renaming functionality:
    - Add `TreeViewNodeRenameInput` component for inline node label editing
    - Add `canRename` prop to control which nodes can be renamed
    - Add `onRenameStart`, `onBeforeRename`, and `onRenameComplete` callbacks for rename lifecycle
    - Add `CheckedChangeDetails`, `LoadChildrenErrorDetails`, `RenameStartDetails`, and `RenameCompleteDetails` type
      exports

### Fixed

- **Listbox**: Fixed type signature of `useListbox` to accept `MaybeAccessor<UseListboxProps>` instead of just
  `UseListboxProps`. This allows reactive props to be passed correctly.

- **Scroll Area**: Fix RTL horizontal scrollbar positioning on Safari

- **Slider**: Fix issue where slider continues dragging when disabled during drag operation.

- **Switch**: Fix issue where `data-active` is inconsistently applied when `disabled` state changes at runtime

## [5.25.1] - 2025-09-27

### Fixed

- **Date Picker**
  - Fix issue where year range picker doesn't show the hovered range
  - Fix issue where quarter presets returns incorrect date

- **FormatByte**: Add support for `unitSystem` property to allow changing between decimal (1000 bytes) and binary (1024
  bytes) systems.

- **Number Input**: When `formatOptions` is used (like `style: "currency"`), the cursor would jump to the end of the
  input when typing in the middle. The cursor now maintains its relative position during formatting changes.

- **Pin Input**: Fix issue where using the keyboard shortcuts `Cmd+Backspace` and `Cmd+Delete` to delete text in pin
  inputs would insert "undefined" instead of clearing the field.

- **Scroll Area**: Fix issue where resize tracking was not observing the root element, which caused the scrollbar to not
  update when the root element's size changed.

## [5.25.0] - 2025-09-16

### Added

- Added `mergeProps` utility for combining multiple props objects with proper event handler and className merging.
- Added `createContext` utility for creating typed React contexts with improved DX.

```tsx
import { createContext } from '@ark-ui/solid/utils'
```

### Fixed

- **AngleSlider**: Export `angleSliderAnatomy` from the anatomy exports

## [5.24.1] - 2025-09-14

### Fixed

- **General**: Fix issue where `mergeProps` throws when `props` is `undefined` or `null`

## [5.24.0] - 2025-09-14

### Removed

- **TimePicker**: The TimePicker component has been removed from this release. This component was never part of the
  public API and was considered experimental. It had significant bugs and usability issues across all frameworks and
  locales, making it unsuitable for production use.

  **Migration**: We recommend building a custom time picker using the Select component for simple use cases, or
  implementing a time grid pattern for more complex scenarios.

### Added

- **Combobox**: Add `alwaysSubmitOnEnter` prop to allow bypassing the default two-step behavior (Enter to close
  combobox, then Enter to submit form) and instead submit the form immediately on Enter press. This is useful for
  single-field autocomplete forms where Enter should submit the form directly.

- **Dismissable**: Add support for layer types in dismissable layer stack. Layers can now be categorized as `dialog`,
  `popover`, `menu`, or `listbox`. This enables:
  - `data-nested` attribute on nested layers of the same type
  - `data-has-nested` attribute on parent layers with nested children of the same type
  - `--nested-layer-count` CSS variable indicating the number of nested layers of the same type

### Changed

- **Hover Card**: Change default delay values for hover card to improve accessibility.
  - `openDelay`: from `700ms` to `600ms`

- **Tooltip**: Change default delay values for tooltip to improve accessibility.
  [Learn more](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/timing-exposing-content)
  - `openDelay`: from `1000ms` to `400ms`
  - `closeDelay`: from `500ms` to `150ms`

### Fixed

- **Editable**: Allow text selection in editable preview when `autoResize` is enabled

  Previously, when `autoResize` was set to `true`, the preview element had `userSelect: "none"` applied, preventing
  users from selecting text. This has been fixed by removing the `userSelect` style property.

- **File Upload**: Fix regression where clicking the trigger doesn't open the file picker when used within the dropzone

- **Menu**:
  - Fix issue where keyboard activation of menu items with `target="_blank"` would open two tabs
  - Fix issue where hovering a partially visible item with pointer causes it to scroll into view

- **Tabs**: Fix issue where `ids` for `item` and `content` could not be customized

- **Toast**: Allow creating a toast store without any arguments

## [5.23.0] - 2025-09-08

### Added

- **Field**: Add `data-required` attribute to `Field.Label`
- **Select, Combobox, Listbox, TreeView**: Export `RootComponent` and `RootProviderComponent` types which are useful
  when building compositions that wrap the `Root` and `RootProvider` components and you still want type-safety for the
  collection.

  ```tsx
  import { Select } from '@ark-ui/solid/select'
  import { styled } from 'styling-lib'

  const Root = styled(Select.Root) as Select.RootComponent<{}>
  ```

### Fixed

- **Menu**: Fix `Menu.ItemText` not working inside `Menu.TriggerItem`

## [5.22.0] - 2025-08-28

### Added

- **Combobox**: Add `ComboboxEmpty` component to display content when the combobox has no items

- **Listbox**: Add `ListboxEmpty` component to display content when the listbox has no items

- **Hover Card**: Add support for `disabled` prop

### Fixed

- **Collection**: Fix issue where disabled items could be reached via typeahead

- **Color Picker**: Fix issue where color picker was not working correctly in RTL mode

- **Date Picker**: Fix issue where datepicker doesn't revert to a valid value when the input value exceeds the min/max
  and blurred

- **Dismissable**: Expose `onRequestDismiss` custom event handler for event a parent layer requests the child layer to
  dismiss. If prevented via `event.preventDefault()`, the child layer will not dismiss when the parent layer is
  dismissed.

- **Number Input**
  - Omit the input `pattern` when `formatOptions` is provided. This prevents native pattern validation from conflicting
    with formatted values (e.g., currency or percent).
  - Handle empty values consistently across all format options.
  - Add `data-scrubbing` attribute to the number input parts.

- **Tags Input**: Fix issue where highlighted item doesn't clear when tabbing out of the input to an external button
  within the `control` part.

- **Tooltip**
  - Set `closeOnPointerdown` to `false` when `closeOnClick` is set to `false`
  - Reduce bundle size by replacing `@zag-js/store` dependency with a lightweight store implementation.

## [5.21.0] - 2025-08-24

### Added

- **Hooks**: Add `useAsyncList` and `useCollator` hooks for managing asynchronous list operations and locale-aware
  string comparison

  `ToastStatusChangeDetails`, and `ToastType`

### Changed

- **Fieldset**:
  - Update Legend component to render as `div` instead of `legend` element for improved styling flexibility
  - Add `aria-labelledby` attribute to fieldset root for better accessibility by linking to legend

### Fixed

- **Date Picker**
  - Clear hovered range state after completing range selection instead of waiting for pointer to leave the calendar
    area.
  - Fix issue where month and year select labels don't update correctly when using `min`/`max` constraints.
  - Expose `disabled` on `api.getMonths()` and `api.getYears()` results to indicate options out of range for current
    constraints.

- **Listbox**
  - Fix issue where first enabled item should be highlighted by default when listbox receives focus and no item is
    currently highlighted.
  - Add `getElement` to `scrollToIndexFn` details
  - Track collection changes and clear `highlightedValue` if the item is no longer in the collection.

- **ScrollArea**
  - Avoid detecting hover state from portalled descendants.
  - Add `data-dragging` attribute to scroll area parts.

- **Select**: Add `getElement` to `scrollToIndexFn` details

- **Combobox**: Add `getElement` to `scrollToIndexFn` details

  - Fix an issue where the carousel would not update when `slideCount` or `autoplay` props change.
  - Fix an issue where `loop: false` was ignored when using autoplay. Now, the carousel will stop when it gets to the
    last slide.

  versus popover date pickers.

- **Menu**: Fix issue where `onCheckedChange` could be called twice on checkbox or radio item

  selection modes

  ```jsx
  const collection = createListCollection({ items: ['React', 'Vue', 'Angular'] })
  const selection = useListSelection({ collection })

  // Check if item is selected
  const isSelected = selection.isSelected('React')

  // Select/deselect items
  selection.select('React')
  selection.toggle('Vue')
  ```

- **File Upload**: Add support for programmatically controlling the accepted files via `acceptedFiles` and
  `defaultAcceptedFiles`

- **Signature Pad**: Add support for programmatically controlling the paths via `paths` and `defaultPaths` props.

- **Date Picker**: Added hover range preview support for date picker range selection. Added `inHoveredRange`,
  `firstInHoveredRange`, and `lastInHoveredRange` properties to `DayTableCellState` with corresponding data attributes
  `data-in-hover-range`, `data-hover-range-start`, and `data-hover-range-end`.

  Hover range states are only active when not overlapping with actual selected range, enabling distinct styling for
  hover preview vs actual selection in range mode.

### Fixed

- **Date Picker**: Fix date comparison issues when time components are involved. This resolves critical issues with date
  comparison operations when different date types (`CalendarDate`, `CalendarDateTime`, `ZonedDateTime`) are mixed,

  - Fix issue where calling `api.setFiles` invokes validation with incorrect `acceptedFiles`
  - Fix issue where the browser might not be able to infer the mime type of a file due to limitations, drag source or
    security restrictions. As a fallback in the file validation logic, we now infer the mime type from the file
    extension.

  ```ts
  const tree = new TreeCollection({
    rootNode: {
      value: 'ROOT',
      children: [{ value: 'child1' }, { value: 'child2' }],
    },
  })

  const flattened = tree.flatten()
  const reconstructed = flattenedToTree(flattened)

## [5.0.0] - 2025-03-06

Ark UI just got a major performance boost! 🚀

### What’s new in v5?

- **Blazing-fast performance** – Every component runs smoother and renders faster.
- **Smaller bundle size** – Leaner components and adapters for a more efficient build.

We made this happen by using Solid's native reactive primitives instead of external stores.

In our stress tests with **10,000 components**, Ark v5 delivered **1.5x–4x** better performance across the board.

### A quick note on tests

Most component updates are non-breaking, but due to this change, some tests may need adjustments. For example:

```jsx
// Before
it('should open by default', () => {
  render(() => <ComponentUnderTest defaultOpen />)
  expect(screen.getByRole('dialog')).toBeInTheDocument()
})

// After
it('should open by default', async () => {
  render(() => <ComponentUnderTest defaultOpen />)
  expect(await screen.findByRole('dialog')).toBeInTheDocument()
})
```

- **Carousel**: ⚠️ Breaking change: Added required prop `slideCount` to `Carousel.Root` component.
- **Clipboard**: Added `onValueChange` and `defaultValue` props.
- **ColorPicker**: Added `defaultFormat` prop.
- **Combobox**: Added `defaultHighlightedValue` and `defaultInputValue` props.
- **DatePicker**: Added `defaultFocusedValue` prop, `getViewProps`, and `visibleRangeText`.
- **HoverCard**: Expanded interaction handlers.
- **Menu**: Added `defaultHighlightedValue` prop.
- **Pagination**: Added `defaultPageSize` prop.
- **PinInput**: Added `count` prop for better SSR aria-label.
- **Progress**: Added `locale` and `formatOptions` props.
- **QrCode**: Added `pixelSize` prop.
- **Select**: Added `defaultHighlightedValue` prop.
- **TagsInput**: Added `defaultInputValue` prop.
- **Toggle**: Reintroduced toggle machine.

#### Fixed

- **Accordion**: Fixed issue in Safari where clicking triggers didn't show content.
- **Avatar**: Fixed `api.setSrc` not working.
- **Carousel**: Fixed pagination sync and initial page issues.
- **File Upload**: Fixed drag-and-drop when `directory: true`.
- **Menu**: Fixed context menu positioning not updating on right-click.
- **Number Input**: Fixed `value` prop not being consumed.

# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Marquee** [New]: Initial release of marquee component for continuously scrolling content

### Fixed

- **Angle Slider**: Resolved an issue where dragging the thumb from non-center positions caused unexpected value jumps.
  The thumb now maintains consistent positioning relative to the initial click point.

- **Slider**: Fixed a problem where the thumb offset shifted dynamically during dragging, resulting in value jumps. The
  offset now remains constant from the pointer throughout the drag operation.

- **Svelte**: Refactored `mergeProps` to return class values as arrays, delegating resolution to Svelte's native class
  handling for improved support of conditional classes and objects.

## [5.11.2] - 2025-10-18

### Fixed

- **Angle Slider**: Fix accessibility violation where the slider thumb element lacked an accessible name. The thumb now
  supports `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby` props, and automatically falls back to the label element's ID for proper
  ARIA labeling.

- **Select**: Fix accessibility violation where the required state was not set correctly to on the trigger.

- **Tags Input**: Fix issue where entering a custom tag with combobox integration required pressing `Enter` twice. The
  tags-input now correctly handles custom values when the combobox has no highlighted item (`aria-activedescendant` is
  empty), allowing the tag to be added on the first `Enter` press.

## [5.11.1] - 2025-10-15

### Fixed

- **Checkbox**
  - Fix issue where setting initial checked state to `indeterminate` doesn't work
  - Ensure `api.checkedState` returns the correct checked state (`boolean | "indeterminate"`)

- **Collapsible**: Fix issue where `dir` prop value was hardcoded to `ltr` instead of using the provided value

- **Combobox**: Fix issue where controlled single-select combobox does not propagate its initial value to `inputValue`

- **Listbox**: Fix issue where pressing Enter key when no highlighted item still calls `event.preventDefault()`

- **Radio Group**: Refactor to use `getBoundingClientRect()` for precise indicator positioning

- **Slider**
  - Fix issue where slider could stop abruptly when scrubbing thumb
  - Fix issue where range slider thumbs become stuck when dragged to the same position without `minStepsBetweenThumbs`

- **Tabs**: Refactor to use `getBoundingClientRect()` for precise indicator positioning

- **Tags Input**: Fix issue where `maxLength` doesn't apply to the edit input as well

## [5.11.0] - 2025-10-08

### Added

- **Collapsible**: Add support for `collapsedHeight` and `collapsedWidth` props to control the dimensions of the
  collapsible content when in its collapsed state.

- **Focus Trap**: Allow elements referenced by `aria-controls` to be included in the trap scope. This makes it possible
  for menus, popovers, etc. to be portalled and work correctly.

- **Pagination**: Add `getPageUrl` prop for generating `href` attributes when using pagination as links.

```ts
const service = useMachine(pagination.machine, {
  type: 'link',
  getPageUrl: ({ page, pageSize }) => `/products?page=${page}&size=${pageSize}`,
})
```

- **Select**: Add `SelectRootComponentProps` type export for better component type composition.

- **Listbox**: Add `ListboxRootComponentProps` type export for better component type composition.

- **Combobox**: Add `ComboboxRootComponentProps` type export for better component type composition.

- **TreeView**:
  - Add `TreeViewRootComponentProps` type export for better component type composition.
  - (Experimental) Add support for node renaming functionality:
    - Add `TreeViewNodeRenameInput` component for inline node label editing
    - Add `canRename` prop to control which nodes can be renamed
    - Add `onRenameStart`, `onBeforeRename`, and `onRenameComplete` callbacks for rename lifecycle
    - Add `CheckedChangeDetails`, `LoadChildrenErrorDetails`, `RenameStartDetails`, and `RenameCompleteDetails` type
      exports

### Fixed

- **Select**: Fix issue where `Select.HiddenSelect` doesn't emit correct values when using custom objects with
  `itemToValue`

- **Field**: Fix issue where `bind:value` doesn't work correctly in `Field.Textarea`, `Field.Input`, and `Field.Select`
  components

- **Password Input**: Fix issue where `bind:value` doesn't work correctly in `PasswordInput.Input` component

- **Scroll Area**: Fix RTL horizontal scrollbar positioning on Safari

- **Slider**: Fix issue where slider continues dragging when disabled during drag operation.

- **Switch**: Fix issue where `data-active` is inconsistently applied when `disabled` state changes at runtime

- **Presence**: Fix issue where exit animations don't work on subsequent toggles when using `lazyMount` and
  `unmountOnExit` together

## [5.10.1] - 2025-09-27

### Fixed

- **Date Picker**
  - Fix issue where year range picker doesn't show the hovered range
  - Fix issue where quarter presets returns incorrect date

- **FormatByte**: Add support for `unitSystem` property to allow changing between decimal (1000 bytes) and binary (1024
  bytes) systems.

- **Number Input**: When `formatOptions` is used (like `style: "currency"`), the cursor would jump to the end of the
  input when typing in the middle. The cursor now maintains its relative position during formatting changes.

- **Pin Input**: Fix issue where using the keyboard shortcuts `Cmd+Backspace` and `Cmd+Delete` to delete text in pin
  inputs would insert "undefined" instead of clearing the field.

- **Scroll Area**: Fix issue where resize tracking was not observing the root element, which caused the scrollbar to not
  update when the root element's size changed.

- **Select**: Fix inconsistent `lazyMount`/`unmountOnExit` behavior where the positioner remained in the DOM when the
  component was closed, while the content was correctly unmounted.

- **Exports**: Fix issue where Node.js programs like PandaCSS were not able to resolve the `@ark-ui/svelte/anatomy`
  entrypoint due to the missing `default` condition

## [5.10.0] - 2025-09-17

### Added

- Added `mergeProps` utility for combining multiple props objects with proper event handler and className merging.
- Added `createContext` utility for creating typed React contexts with improved DX.

```tsx
import { createContext } from '@ark-ui/solid/utils'
```

## [5.9.1] - 2025-09-14

### Fixed

- **General**: Fix issue where `mergeProps` throws when `props` is `undefined` or `null`

## [5.9.0] - 2025-09-14

### Removed

- **TimePicker**: The TimePicker component has been removed from this release. This component was never part of the
  public API and was considered experimental. It had significant bugs and usability issues across all frameworks and
  locales, making it unsuitable for production use.

  **Migration**: We recommend building a custom time picker using the Select component for simple use cases, or
  implementing a time grid pattern for more complex scenarios.

### Added

- **Combobox**: Add `alwaysSubmitOnEnter` prop to allow bypassing the default two-step behavior (Enter to close
  combobox, then Enter to submit form) and instead submit the form immediately on Enter press. This is useful for
  single-field autocomplete forms where Enter should submit the form directly.

- **Dismissable**: Add support for layer types in dismissable layer stack. Layers can now be categorized as `dialog`,
  `popover`, `menu`, or `listbox`. This enables:
  - `data-nested` attribute on nested layers of the same type
  - `data-has-nested` attribute on parent layers with nested children of the same type
  - `--nested-layer-count` CSS variable indicating the number of nested layers of the same type

### Changed

- **Hover Card**: Change default delay values for hover card to improve accessibility.
  - `openDelay`: from `700ms` to `600ms`

- **Tooltip**: Change default delay values for tooltip to improve accessibility.
  [Learn more](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/timing-exposing-content)
  - `openDelay`: from `1000ms` to `400ms`
  - `closeDelay`: from `500ms` to `150ms`

### Fixed

- **Editable**: Allow text selection in editable preview when `autoResize` is enabled

  Previously, when `autoResize` was set to `true`, the preview element had `userSelect: "none"` applied, preventing
  users from selecting text. This has been fixed by removing the `userSelect` style property.

- **File Upload**: Fix regression where clicking the trigger doesn't open the file picker when used within the dropzone

- **Svelte**: Fix Svelte warning about state reference capturing initial value instead of current reactive state

- **Menu**
  - Fix issue where hovering a partially visible item with pointer causes it to scroll into view
  - Fix issue where keyboard activation of menu items with `target="_blank"` would open two tabs

- **Tabs**: Fix issue where `ids` for `item` and `content` could not be customized

- **Toast**: Allow creating a toast store without any arguments

## [5.8.0] - 2025-09-08

### Added

- **Field**: Add `data-required` attribute to `Field.Label`
- **Select, Combobox, Listbox, TreeView**: Export `RootComponent` and `RootProviderComponent` types which are useful
  when building compositions that wrap the `Root` and `RootProvider` components and you still want type-safety for the
  collection.

### Fixed

- **Collection**: Fix issue where disabled items could be reached via typeahead

- **Color Picker**: Fix issue where color picker was not working correctly in RTL mode

- **Date Picker**: Fix issue where datepicker doesn't revert to a valid value when the input value exceeds the min/max
  and blurred

- **Dismissable**: Expose `onRequestDismiss` custom event handler for event a parent layer requests the child layer to
  dismiss. If prevented via `event.preventDefault()`, the child layer will not dismiss when the parent layer is
  dismissed.

- **Number Input**
  - Omit the input `pattern` when `formatOptions` is provided. This prevents native pattern validation from conflicting
    with formatted values (e.g., currency or percent).
  - Handle empty values consistently across all format options.
  - Add `data-scrubbing` attribute to the number input parts.

- **Tags Input**: Fix issue where highlighted item doesn't clear when tabbing out of the input to an external button
  within the `control` part.

- **Tooltip**
  - Set `closeOnPointerdown` to `false` when `closeOnClick` is set to `false`
  - Reduce bundle size by replacing `@zag-js/store` dependency with a lightweight store implementation.

## [5.6.0] - 2025-08-24

### Added

- **Functions**: Add `useAsyncList` and `useCollator` functions for managing asynchronous list operations and

    area.
  - Fix issue where month and year select labels don't update correctly when using `min`/`max` constraints.
  - Expose `disabled` on `api.getMonths()` and `api.getYears()` results to indicate options out of range for current
    constraints.

- **Listbox**
  - Fix issue where first enabled item should be highlighted by default when listbox receives focus and no item is
    currently highlighted.
  - Add `getElement` to `scrollToIndexFn` details
  - Track collection changes and clear `highlightedValue` if the item is no longer in the collection.

- **ScrollArea**
  - Avoid detecting hover state from portalled descendants.
  - Add `data-dragging` attribute to scroll area parts.

- **Select**: Add `getElement` to `scrollToIndexFn` details

- **Combobox**: Add `getElement` to `scrollToIndexFn` details

  selection.select('Svelte')
  selection.toggle('Angular')
  ```

  accepted files

- **Signature Pad**: Add support for `bind:paths` and `defaultPaths` to programmatically control the paths

- **Date Picker**: Added hover range preview support for date picker range selection. Added `inHoveredRange`,
  `firstInHoveredRange`, and `lastInHoveredRange` properties to `DayTableCellState` with corresponding data attributes

  Hover range states are only active when not overlapping with actual selected range, enabling distinct styling for
  hover preview vs actual selection in range mode.

### Fixed

- **Date Picker**: Fix date comparison issues when time components are involved. This resolves critical issues with date

# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Marquee** [New]: Initial release of marquee component for continuously scrolling content

### Fixed

- **Angle Slider**: Resolved an issue where dragging the thumb from non-center positions caused unexpected value jumps.
  The thumb now maintains consistent positioning relative to the initial click point.

- **Slider**: Fixed a problem where the thumb offset shifted dynamically during dragging, resulting in value jumps. The
  offset now remains constant from the pointer throughout the drag operation.

- **Dialog**: Fix issue where `Dialog.Backdrop` does not respect exit animations when closing. The backdrop now properly
  uses the presence composable to enable CSS transitions and animations on close.

- **Bottom Sheet**: Fix issue where `BottomSheet.Backdrop` does not respect exit animations when closing.

- **Tour**: Fix issue where `Tour.Backdrop` does not respect exit animations when closing.

- **Tabs**: Fix issue where `Tab.Content` does not respect exit animations when switching tabs.

## [5.26.2] - 2025-10-18

### Fixed

- **Angle Slider**: Fix accessibility violation where the slider thumb element lacked an accessible name. The thumb now
  supports `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby` props, and automatically falls back to the label element's ID for proper
  ARIA labeling.

- **Select**: Fix accessibility violation where the required state was not set correctly to on the trigger.

- **Tags Input**: Fix issue where entering a custom tag with combobox integration required pressing `Enter` twice. The
  tags-input now correctly handles custom values when the combobox has no highlighted item (`aria-activedescendant` is
  empty), allowing the tag to be added on the first `Enter` press.

## [5.26.1] - 2025-10-15

### Fixed

- **Checkbox**
  - Fix issue where setting initial checked state to `indeterminate` doesn't work
  - Ensure `api.checkedState` returns the correct checked state (`boolean | "indeterminate"`)

- **Collapsible**: Fix issue where `dir` prop value was hardcoded to `ltr` instead of using the provided value

- **Combobox**: Fix issue where controlled single-select combobox does not propagate its initial value to `inputValue`

- **Listbox**: Fix issue where pressing Enter key when no highlighted item still calls `event.preventDefault()`

- **Radio Group**: Refactor to use `getBoundingClientRect()` for precise indicator positioning

- **Slider**
  - Fix issue where slider could stop abruptly when scrubbing thumb
  - Fix issue where range slider thumbs become stuck when dragged to the same position without `minStepsBetweenThumbs`

- **Tabs**: Refactor to use `getBoundingClientRect()` for precise indicator positioning

- **Tags Input**: Fix issue where `maxLength` doesn't apply to the edit input as well

## [5.26.0] - 2025-10-08

### Added

- **Collapsible**: Add support for `collapsedHeight` and `collapsedWidth` props to control the dimensions of the
  collapsible content when in its collapsed state.

- **Focus Trap**: Allow elements referenced by `aria-controls` to be included in the trap scope. This makes it possible
  for menus, popovers, etc. to be portalled and work correctly.

- **Pagination**: Add `getPageUrl` prop for generating `href` attributes when using pagination as links.

```ts
const service = useMachine(pagination.machine, {
  type: 'link',
  getPageUrl: ({ page, pageSize }) => `/products?page=${page}&size=${pageSize}`,
})
```

- **Select**: Add `SelectRootComponentProps` type export for better component type composition.

- **Listbox**: Add `ListboxRootComponentProps` type export for better component type composition.

- **Combobox**: Add `ComboboxRootComponentProps` type export for better component type composition.

- **TreeView**:
  - Add `TreeViewRootComponentProps` type export for better component type composition.
  - (Experimental) Add support for node renaming functionality:
    - Add `TreeViewNodeRenameInput` component for inline node label editing
    - Add `canRename` prop to control which nodes can be renamed
    - Add `renameStart`, `beforeRename`, and `renameComplete` event emitters for rename lifecycle
    - Add `CheckedChangeDetails`, `LoadChildrenErrorDetails`, `RenameStartDetails`, and `RenameCompleteDetails` type
      exports

### Fixed

- **Scroll Area**: Fix RTL horizontal scrollbar positioning on Safari

- **Slider**: Fix issue where slider continues dragging when disabled during drag operation.

- **Switch**: Fix issue where `data-active` is inconsistently applied when `disabled` state changes at runtime

## [5.25.1] - 2025-09-27

### Fixed

- **Date Picker**
  - Fix issue where year range picker doesn't show the hovered range
  - Fix issue where quarter presets returns incorrect date

- **FormatByte**: Add support for `unitSystem` property to allow changing between decimal (1000 bytes) and binary (1024
  bytes) systems.

- **Number Input**: When `formatOptions` is used (like `style: "currency"`), the cursor would jump to the end of the
  input when typing in the middle. The cursor now maintains its relative position during formatting changes.

- **Pin Input**: Fix issue where using the keyboard shortcuts `Cmd+Backspace` and `Cmd+Delete` to delete text in pin
  inputs would insert "undefined" instead of clearing the field.

- **Scroll Area**: Fix issue where resize tracking was not observing the root element, which caused the scrollbar to not
  update when the root element's size changed.

## [5.25.0] - 2025-09-16

### Added

- Added `mergeProps` utility for combining multiple props objects with proper event handler and className merging.
- Added `createContext` utility for creating typed React contexts with improved DX.

```tsx
import { createContext } from '@ark-ui/solid/utils'
```

### Fixed

- **General**: Fix issue where `mergeProps` throws when `props` is `undefined` or `null`

## [5.24.0] - 2025-09-14

### Removed

- **TimePicker**: The TimePicker component has been removed from this release. This component was never part of the
  public API and was considered experimental. It had significant bugs and usability issues across all frameworks and
  locales, making it unsuitable for production use.

  **Migration**: We recommend building a custom time picker using the Select component for simple use cases, or
  implementing a time grid pattern for more complex scenarios.

### Added

- **Combobox**: Add `alwaysSubmitOnEnter` prop to allow bypassing the default two-step behavior (Enter to close
  combobox, then Enter to submit form) and instead submit the form immediately on Enter press. This is useful for
  single-field autocomplete forms where Enter should submit the form directly.

- **Dismissable**: Add support for layer types in dismissable layer stack. Layers can now be categorized as `dialog`,
  `popover`, `menu`, or `listbox`. This enables:
  - `data-nested` attribute on nested layers of the same type
  - `data-has-nested` attribute on parent layers with nested children of the same type
  - `--nested-layer-count` CSS variable indicating the number of nested layers of the same type

### Changed

- **Hover Card**: Change default delay values for hover card to improve accessibility.
  - `openDelay`: from `700ms` to `600ms`

- **Tooltip**: Change default delay values for tooltip to improve accessibility.
  [Learn more](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/timing-exposing-content)
  - `openDelay`: from `1000ms` to `400ms`
  - `closeDelay`: from `500ms` to `150ms`

### Fixed

- **Editable**: Allow text selection in editable preview when `autoResize` is enabled

  Previously, when `autoResize` was set to `true`, the preview element had `userSelect: "none"` applied, preventing
  users from selecting text. This has been fixed by removing the `userSelect` style property.

- **File Upload**: Fix regression where clicking the trigger doesn't open the file picker when used within the dropzone

- **Menu**:
  - Fix issue where keyboard activation of menu items with `target="_blank"` would open two tabs
  - Fix issue where hovering a partially visible item with pointer causes it to scroll into view

- **Tabs**: Fix issue where `ids` for `item` and `content` could not be customized

- **Toast**: Allow creating a toast store without any arguments

## [5.23.0] - 2025-09-08

### Added

- **Field**: Add `data-required` attribute to `Field.Label`
- **Select, Combobox, Listbox, TreeView**: Export `RootComponent` and `RootProviderComponent` types which are useful
  when building compositions that wrap the `Root` and `RootProvider` components and you still want type-safety for the
  collection.

## [5.22.0] - 2025-08-28

### Added

- **Color Picker**: Fix issue where color picker was not working correctly in RTL mode

- **Date Picker**: Fix issue where datepicker doesn't revert to a valid value when the input value exceeds the min/max
  and blurred

- **Dismissable**: Expose `onRequestDismiss` custom event handler for event a parent layer requests the child layer to
  dismiss. If prevented via `event.preventDefault()`, the child layer will not dismiss when the parent layer is
  dismissed.

- **Number Input**
  - Omit the input `pattern` when `formatOptions` is provided. This prevents native pattern validation from conflicting
    with formatted values (e.g., currency or percent).
  - Handle empty values consistently across all format options.
  - Add `data-scrubbing` attribute to the number input parts.

- **Tags Input**: Fix issue where highlighted item doesn't clear when tabbing out of the input to an external button
  within the `control` part.

- **Tooltip**
  - Set `closeOnPointerdown` to `false` when `closeOnClick` is set to `false`
  - Reduce bundle size by replacing `@zag-js/store` dependency with a lightweight store implementation.

## [5.21.0] - 2025-08-24

### Added

- **Composables**: Add `useAsyncList` and `useCollator` composables for managing asynchronous list operations and
  locale-aware string comparison

  - Update Legend component to render as `div` instead of `legend` element for improved styling flexibility
  - Add `aria-labelledby` attribute to fieldset root for better accessibility by linking to legend

### Fixed

- **Date Picker**
  - Clear hovered range state after completing range selection instead of waiting for pointer to leave the calendar
    area.
  - Fix issue where month and year select labels don't update correctly when using `min`/`max` constraints.
  - Expose `disabled` on `api.getMonths()` and `api.getYears()` results to indicate options out of range for current
    constraints.

- **Listbox**
  - Fix issue where first enabled item should be highlighted by default when listbox receives focus and no item is
    currently highlighted.
  - Add `getElement` to `scrollToIndexFn` details
  - Track collection changes and clear `highlightedValue` if the item is no longer in the collection.

- **ScrollArea**
  - Avoid detecting hover state from portalled descendants.
  - Add `data-dragging` attribute to scroll area parts.

- **Select**: Add `getElement` to `scrollToIndexFn` details

- **Combobox**: Add `getElement` to `scrollToIndexFn` details

## [5.20.0] - 2025-08-20

- **Carousel**:
  - Fix an issue where the carousel would not update when `slideCount` or `autoplay` props change.
  - Fix an issue where `loop: false` was ignored when using autoplay. Now, the carousel will stop when it gets to the
    last slide.

- **Date Picker**: Expose `data-inline` attribute on Content part to enable distinct styling for inline date pickers
  versus popover date pickers.

- **Menu**: Fix issue where `onCheckedChange` could be called twice on checkbox or radio item

- **Radio Group**: Fixed issue where arrow key navigation doesn't apply `data-focus-visible` on the newly focused item.

- **TagsInput**: Export `InputValueChangeDetails` type
- **Field**: Fix issue where `asChild` prop is not being applied to the input and select components, leading to
  hydration mismatch.

  const selection = useListSelection({ collection })

  // Check if item is selected
  const isSelected = selection.isSelected('Vue')

  // Select/deselect items
  selection.select('Vue')
  selection.toggle('Angular')
  </script>
  ```

  `data-in-hover-range`, `data-hover-range-start`, and `data-hover-range-end`.

  Hover range states are only active when not overlapping with actual selected range, enabling distinct styling for
  hover preview vs actual selection in range mode.

  > Previously, `tree.flatten()` would return an array of objects with `value` and `label` stripping out the original
  > node properties.

  ```ts
  const tree = new TreeCollection({
    rootNode: {
      value: 'ROOT',
      children: [{ value: 'child1' }, { value: 'child2' }],
    },
  })

## [5.0.1] - 2025-03-06

Ark UI just got a major performance boost! 🚀

### What’s new in v5?

- **Blazing-fast performance** – Every component runs smoother and renders faster.
- **Smaller bundle size** – Leaner components and adapters for a more efficient build.

We made this happen by using Vue's native reactive primitives instead of external stores.

In our stress tests with **10,000 components**, Ark v5 delivered **1.5x–4x** better performance across the board.

### A quick note on tests

Most component updates are non-breaking, but due to this change, some tests may need adjustments. For example:

```jsx
// Before
it('should open by default', () => {
  render(ComponentUnderTest, {
    props: {
      defaultOpen: true,
    },
  })
  expect(screen.getByRole('dialog')).toBeInTheDocument()
})

// After
it('should open by default', async () => {
  render(ComponentUnderTest, {
    props: {
      defaultOpen: true,
    },
  })
  expect(await screen.findByRole('dialog')).toBeInTheDocument()
})
```

#### Added

- **Carousel**: ⚠️ Breaking change: Added required prop `slideCount` to `Carousel.Root` component.
- **Clipboard**: Added `onValueChange` and `defaultValue` props.
- **ColorPicker**: Added `defaultFormat` prop.
- **Combobox**: Added `defaultHighlightedValue` and `defaultInputValue` props.
- **DatePicker**: Added `defaultFocusedValue` prop, `getViewProps`, and `visibleRangeText`.
- **HoverCard**: Expanded interaction handlers.
- **Menu**: Added `defaultHighlightedValue` prop.
- **Pagination**: Added `defaultPageSize` prop.
- **PinInput**: Added `count` prop for better SSR aria-label.
- **Progress**: Added `locale` and `formatOptions` props.
- **QrCode**: Added `pixelSize` prop.
- **Select**: Added `defaultHighlightedValue` prop.
- **TagsInput**: Added `defaultInputValue` prop.
- **Toggle**: Reintroduced toggle machine.

#### Fixed

- **Accordion**: Fixed issue in Safari where clicking triggers didn't show content.
- **Avatar**: Fixed `api.setSrc` not working.
- **Carousel**: Fixed pagination sync and initial page issues.
- **File Upload**: Fixed drag-and-drop when `directory: true`.
- **Menu**: Fixed context menu positioning not updating on right-click.
- **Number Input**: Fixed `value` prop not being consumed.
- **Pin Input**: Fixed focus warnings and editing issues.
- **Progress**: Allowed more precise (decimal) values.
- **Radio Group, Switch**: Improved focus behavior in Safari.
- **Select**: Fixed regression where `multiple: true` didn't work.
- **Steps**: Ensured ARIA attributes use valid values and wrapped `<li>` elements correctly within `<ul>` or `<ol>`.
- **Textarea**: Fixed `ResizeObserver` warning.
- **Timer**: Fixed stopping issue when switching tabs; resolved issue where `action` prop was passed to `ActionTrigger`.
- **Toast**: Fixed keyboard navigation skipping close button.
- **Toggle Group**: Fixed `data-focus` not being removed on blur.

# Animation

Adding animation to Ark UI Components is as straightforward as with any other component, but keep in mind some
considerations when working with exit animations with JavaScript animation libraries.

## Animating with CSS

The most straightforward method to animate your elements is using CSS. You can animate both the mounting and unmounting
phases with CSS. The latter is achievable because Ark UI Components postpones the unmounting while your animation runs.

Below is a simple example of creating a fade-in and fade-out animation using CSS keyframes:

```css
@keyframes fadeIn {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}

@keyframes fadeOut {
  from {
    opacity: 1;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 0;
  }
}
```

You can use these keyframes to animate any element during its lifecycle. For instance, to apply the `fadeIn` animation
when your `Tooltip` enters the 'open' state, and `fadeOut` when it enters the 'closed' state, you could use the
following styles:

```css
[data-scope='tooltip'][data-part='content'][data-state='open'] {
  animation: fadeIn 300ms ease-out;
}

[data-scope='tooltip'][data-part='content'][data-state='closed'] {
  animation: fadeOut 300ms ease-in;
}
```

## Animating with JS Libraries

There's plenty of versatility when it comes to animating your Ark UI Elements with JavaScript libraries. Various
libraries such as GreenSock, anime.js, Framer Motion, and more can add a new level of interaction and feedback to your
UI components.

One significant advantage of using Ark UI Elements is the control you have over the unmounting phase of your components.
This is primarily facilitated through the `present` prop. The `present` prop allows the component to stay mounted even
after its enclosing condition has been falsified, allowing for exit animations to complete before the component is
removed from the DOM.


# Closed Components

## Motivation

Writing a few lines of code every time you need a simple `Avatar` is tedious. Creating a dedicated component
encapsulates logic, simplifies the API, ensures consistent usage, and maintains clean code. This approach enhances
reusability, making the component easier to maintain and test.

Here's an example of an `Avatar` component that can be used consistently across your application:

```tsx
import { Avatar as ArkAvatar } from '@ark-ui/solid/avatar'
import { UserIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Show, splitProps } from 'solid-js'

export interface AvatarProps extends ArkAvatar.RootProps {
  name?: string
  src?: string
}

export const Avatar = (props: AvatarProps) => {
  const [localProps, rootProps] = splitProps(props, ['name', 'src'])

  return (
    <ArkAvatar.Root {...rootProps}>
      <ArkAvatar.Fallback>
        <Show when={localProps.name} fallback={<UserIcon />}>
          {getInitials(localProps.name)}
        </Show>
      </ArkAvatar.Fallback>
      <ArkAvatar.Image src={localProps.src} alt={localProps.name} />
    </ArkAvatar.Root>
  )
}

const getInitials = (name = '') =>
  name
    .split(' ')
    .map((part) => part[0])
    .splice(0, 2)
    .join('')
    .toUpperCase()
```

## Usage

To use the `Avatar` component, pass the `name` and `src` props as shown below:

```jsx
<Avatar name="Christian" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1846056?v=4" />
```


# Component State

## Context Components

Context components expose state and functions to child components. In this example, `Avatar.Fallback` renders based on
`loaded` state.

```tsx
import { Avatar } from '@ark-ui/solid/avatar'

export const Context = () => (
  <Avatar.Root>
    <Avatar.Context>
      {(avatar) => <Avatar.Fallback>{avatar().loaded ? 'PA' : 'Loading'}</Avatar.Fallback>}
    </Avatar.Context>
    <Avatar.Image src="https://i.pravatar.cc/300" alt="avatar" />
  </Avatar.Root>
)
```

> **Good to know (RSC)**: Due to the usage of render prop, you might need to add the `'use client'` directive at the top
> of your file when using React Server Components.

## Provider Components

Provider components can help coordinate state and behavior between multiple components, enabling interactions that
aren't possible with `Context` components alone. They are used alongside component hooks.

```tsx
import { Accordion, useAccordion } from '@ark-ui/solid/accordion'
import { ChevronDownIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const accordion = useAccordion({
    multiple: true,
    defaultValue: ['React'],
  })

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => accordion().setValue(['Vue'])}>Set to Vue</button>

      <Accordion.RootProvider value={accordion}>
        <Index each={['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte']}>
          {(item) => (
            <Accordion.Item value={item()}>
              <Accordion.ItemTrigger>
                What is {item()}?
                <Accordion.ItemIndicator>
                  <ChevronDownIcon />
                </Accordion.ItemIndicator>
              </Accordion.ItemTrigger>
              <Accordion.ItemContent>
                {item()} is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
              </Accordion.ItemContent>
            </Accordion.Item>
          )}
        </Index>
      </Accordion.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

> When using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

See more in [Examples](/examples/popover-selection).


# Composition

## The asChild Prop

In Ark UI, the `asChild` prop lets you integrate custom components, ensuring consistent styling and behavior while
promoting flexibility and reusability. All Ark components that render a DOM element accept the `asChild` prop.

Here's an example using `asChild` to integrate a custom `Button` component within a `Popover`:

```tsx
import { Popover } from '@ark-ui/solid/popover'

export const Basic = () => (
  <Popover.Root>
    <Popover.Trigger asChild={(props) => <button {...props()} />}>Open</Popover.Trigger>
  </Popover.Root>
)
```

In this example, the `asChild` prop allows the `Button` to be used as the trigger for the `Popover`, inheriting its
behaviors from Popover.Trigger.

## The Ark Factory

You can use the `ark` factory to create your own elements that work just like Ark UI components.

```tsx
import { ark } from '@ark-ui/solid/factory'

export const ArkFactory = () => (
  <ark.div
    id="parent"
    class="parent"
    style={{ background: 'red' }}
    asChild={(props) => <ark.span {...props({ id: 'child', class: 'child', style: { color: 'blue' } })} />}
  >
    Ark UI
  </ark.div>
)
```

This will produce the following HTML:

```html
<span id="child" class="parent child" style="background: red; color: blue;">Ark UI</span>
```

## ID Composition

When composing components that need to work together, share IDs between them using the `ids` prop for proper
accessibility and interaction.

```tsx
import { Avatar } from '@ark-ui/react/avatar'
import { Tooltip } from '@ark-ui/react/tooltip'
import { useId } from 'react'

export const TooltipWithAvatar = () => {
  const id = useId()

  return (
    <Tooltip.Root ids={{ trigger: id }}>
      <Tooltip.Trigger asChild>
        <Avatar.Root ids={{ root: id }}>
          <Avatar.Image src="https://bit.ly/sage-adebayo" />
          <Avatar.Fallback>SA</Avatar.Fallback>
        </Avatar.Root>
      </Tooltip.Trigger>
      <Tooltip.Positioner>
        <Tooltip.Content>Segun Adebayo is online</Tooltip.Content>
      </Tooltip.Positioner>
    </Tooltip.Root>
  )
}
```

Both components share the same `id` through their `ids` props, creating proper accessibility bindings, `aria-*`
attributes and interaction behavior.

## Limitations

When using the `asChild` prop, ensure you pass only a single child element. Passing multiple children may cause
rendering issues.

Certain components, such as `Checkbox.Root` or `RadioGroup.Item`, have specific requirements for their child elements.
For instance, they may require a label element as a child. If you change the underlying element type, ensure it remains
accessible and functional.


# Refs

## React

In React, the `ref` prop can be used to access the rendered element. Use the `useRef` hook to create a reference and
pass it to the component.

```tsx
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/react/slider'
import { useRef } from 'react'

export const MySlider = () => {
  const rootRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement | null>(null)
  return <Slider.Root ref={rootRef}>{/* ... */}</Slider.Root>
}
```

## Solid

In Solid, the `ref` prop can be used to access the rendered element.

```tsx
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/solid/slider'

export const MySlider = () => {
  let rootRef!: HTMLDivElement
  return <Slider.Root ref={(el) => (rootRef = el)}>{/* ... */}</Slider.Root>
}
```

Alternatively, you can assign refs to Solid.js signals via the `createSignal` function.

```tsx
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/solid/slider'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'

export const MySlider = () => {
  const [rootRef, setRootRef] = createSignal<HTMLDivElement | null>(null)
  return <Slider.Root ref={setRootRef}>{/* ... */}</Slider.Root>
}
```

## Vue

In Vue, pass the `ref` prop to the component to access the rendered element via the `$el` property.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/vue/slider'

const rootRef = ref<{ $el: HTMLDivElement } | null>(null)
</script>

<template>
  <Slider.Root ref="rootRef">{/* ... */}</Slider.Root>
</template>
```

## Svelte

In Svelte 5, use the `bind:ref` directive to access the rendered element.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/svelte/slider'

  let rootRef = $state<HTMLDivElement | null>(null)
</script>

<Slider.Root bind:ref={rootRef}>{/* ... */}</Slider.Root>
```


# Styling

## Overview

Ark UI is a headless component library that works with any styling solution. It provides functional styles for elements
like popovers for positioning, while leaving presentation styles up to you. Some components also expose CSS variables
that can be used for styling or animations.

> **Tip:** Looking for a ready-to-use solution? Checkout [Park UI](https://park-ui.com) for a collection of pre-designed
> styles based on Ark UI components.

### Data Attributes

Ark UI components use `data-scope` and `data-part` attributes to target specific elements within a component.
Interactive components often include `data-*` attributes to indicate their state. For example, here's what an open
accordion item looks like:

```html
<div data-scope="accordion" data-part="item" data-state="open"></div>
```

For more details on each component's data attributes, refer to their respective documentation.

## Styling with CSS

When styling components with CSS, you can target the data attributes assigned to each component part for easy
customization.

### Styling a Part

To style a specific component part, target its `data-scope` and `data-part` attributes:

```css
[data-scope='accordion'][data-part='item'] {
  border-bottom: 1px solid #e5e5e5;
}
```

### Styling a State

To style a component based on its state, use the `data-state` attribute:

```css
[data-scope='accordion'][data-part='item'][data-state='open'] {
  background-color: #f5f5f5;
}
```

> **Tip:** If you prefer using classes instead of data attributes, utilize the `class` or `className` prop to add custom
> classes to Ark UI components.

### Class Names

If you prefer using classes instead of data attributes, utilize `class` or `className` prop to add custom classes to Ark
UI components.

Pass a class:

```jsx
<Accordion.Root>
  <Accordion.Item className="AccordionItem">{/* … */}</Accordion.Item>
</Accordion.Root>
```

Then use in styles:

```css
.AccordionItem {
  border-bottom: 1px solid #e5e5e5;

  &[data-state='open'] {
    background-color: #f5f5f5;
  }
}
```

## Styling with Panda CSS

[Panda CSS](https://panda-css.com) is a best-in-class CSS-in-JS framework that integrates seamlessly with Ark UI,
providing an efficient styling solution.

### Styling a part

Panda offers various ways to write styles, but in the context of Ark UI, we recommend using the `defineSlotRecipe`
function to style a component with its different parts and variants.

> **Important:** When importing anatomy objects, we recommend using the `@ark-ui/<framework>/anatomy` entrypoint (e.g.,
> `@ark-ui/react/anatomy`) instead of the main package export to avoid potential build and import errors.

```ts
import { accordionAnatomy } from '@ark-ui/react/anatomy'
import { defineSlotRecipe } from '@pandacss/dev'

export const accordionStyles = defineSlotRecipe({
  className: 'accordion',
  slots: accordionAnatomy.keys(),
  base: {
    item: {
      borderBottom: '1px solid #e5e5e5',
    },
  },
  defaultVariants: {},
  variants: {},
})
```

### Styling a state

To style a component based on its state, you can use built in
[conditions](https://panda-css.com/docs/customization/conditions) in Panda CSS.

```ts
import { accordionAnatomy } from '@ark-ui/react/anatomy'
import { defineSlotRecipe } from '@pandacss/dev'

export const accordionStyles = defineSlotRecipe({
  className: 'accordion',
  slots: accordionAnatomy.keys(),
  base: {
    item: {
      borderBottom: '1px solid {colors.gray.300}',
      _open: {
        // [!code highlight]
        backgroundColor: 'gray.100',
      },
    },
  },
  defaultVariants: {},
  variants: {},
})
```

## Styling with Tailwind CSS

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility-first CSS framework providing a flexible way to style your
components.

### Styling a Part

To style a part, apply classes directly to the parts using either `class` or `className`, depending on the JavaScript
framework.

```jsx
<Accordion.Root>
  <Accordion.Item className="border-b border-gray-300">{/* … */}</Accordion.Item>
</Accordion.Root>
```

### Styling a State

Leverage Tailwind CSS's variant selector to style a component based on its data-state attribute.

```jsx
<Accordion.Root>
  <Accordion.Item className="border-b border-gray-300 data-[state=open]:bg-gray-100">{/* … */}</Accordion.Item>
</Accordion.Root>
```

the routes above based on your framework of choice.


# MCP Server

The Ark UI MCP Server is a specialized [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server
that empowers AI agents to build design system components with full knowledge of Ark UI.

<img src="https://ark-ui.com/images/ark-mcp.png" alt="Ark UI MCP Server" width="100%" height="420px" style={{ borderRadius: '10px' }} />

It works with tools like Claude Code, Cursor, and Copilot to generate code and apply design system logic consistently
across React, Vue, Solid, and Svelte.

## Tools

The Ark UI MCP exposes the following tools to AI agents:

- **`list_components`**: Returns a full list of all available components
- **`list_examples`**: Lists various component examples
- **`get_example`**: Retrieves code examples and usage patterns
- **`styling_guide`**: Provides styling guidelines for components (data attributes and CSS variables)

## Setup

The MCP server currently supports only
[stdio transport](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports#stdio) and is published at
`@ark-ui/mcp`.

### Visual Studio Code

> Make sure you have the [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) and
> [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat) extensions installed.

- In the `.vscode/mcp.json` file at the root of your project, add the MCP server block:

```json title=".vscode/mcp.json"
{
  "servers": {
    "ark-ui": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@ark-ui/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

- The MCP server is now ready to use. Click the **"Start"** button in the `mcp.json` file.

- Start a new chat VSCode Copilot like _"Build me a checkbox with ark ui"_

### Cursor

- In the `.cursor/mcp.json` file at the root of your project, add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ark-ui": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@ark-ui/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

- Go to **Settings** > **Cursor Settings** > **MCP & Integrations** and enable the Ark UI server.

- Start a new chat Cursor chat like _"Build me a checkbox with ark ui"_

### Claude Code

> Make sure you have Claude Code installed. Visit [Anthropic docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp)
> for installation instructions.

- Run the following command in your terminal to add the Ark UI MCP server:

```bash
claude mcp add ark-ui -- npx -y @ark-ui/mcp
```

- Start a Claude Code session by running `claude`

- Type a prompt like _"Build me a checkbox with ark ui"_

### Windsurf

- Navigate to **Settings** > **Windsurf Settings** > **Cascade**

- Click the **Manage MCPs** button, then click the **"View raw config"** button.

- Add the following to the MCP configuration file:

```json title=".codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json"
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ark-ui": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@ark-ui/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

> You might need to click the **Refresh** button to see the MCP server in the list.

- Start a new chat Windsurf like _"Build me a checkbox with ark ui"_

### Zed

- Go to **Settings** > **Open Settings**

- In the `settings.json` file, add MCP server as a new **context server**:

```json title=".config/zed/settings.json"
{
  "context_servers": {
    "ark-ui": {
      "source": "custom",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@ark-ui/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

- Start a new chat Zed like _"Build me a checkbox with ark ui"_

### Custom MCP Client

To run the MCP server in a local or development environment using a custom MCP client, you need to add the MCP server to
the client's configuration file.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ark-ui": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@ark-ui/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```



# COLLECTIONS

# Async List

The `useAsyncList` hook manages asynchronous data operations for list collections. It provides a comprehensive solution
for loading, filtering, sorting, and paginating data with built-in loading states, error handling, and request
cancellation.

```tsx
import { useAsyncList } from '@ark-ui/react/collection'

const list = useAsyncList<User>({
  async load({ signal }) {
    const response = await fetch('/api/users', { signal })
    const users = await response.json()
    return { items: users }
  },
})

console.log(list.items) // User[]
console.log(list.loading) // boolean
console.log(list.error) // Error | null
```

## Examples

### Basic Usage

The most basic usage involves providing a `load` function that returns data.

```tsx
import { useAsyncList } from '@ark-ui/solid/collection'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

interface Quote {
  id: number
  quote: string
  author: string
}

export const Reload = () => {
  const list = useAsyncList<Quote>({
    async load() {
      const response = await fetch(`https://dummyjson.com/quotes?limit=5&skip=${Math.floor(Math.random() * 50)}`)

      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error('Failed to fetch quotes')
      }

      const data = await response.json()
      return { items: data.quotes }
    },
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <button onClick={() => list().reload()} disabled={list().loading}>
          {list().loading ? 'Loading...' : 'Reload Quotes'}
        </button>
      </div>

      {list().error && <div>Error: {list().error.message}</div>}

      <div>
        <For each={list().items}>
          {(quote) => (
            <div>
              <div>"{quote.quote}"</div>
              <div>— {quote.author}</div>
            </div>
          )}
        </For>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Infinite Loading

Implement pagination by returning a cursor that indicates more data is available.

```tsx
import { useAsyncList } from '@ark-ui/solid/collection'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

interface Post {
  userId: number
  id: number
  title: string
  body: string
}

export const InfiniteLoading = () => {
  const list = useAsyncList<Post, number>({
    autoReload: true,
    async load({ cursor }) {
      const page = cursor || 1
      const limit = 10
      const start = (page - 1) * limit

      const response = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?_start=${start}&_limit=${limit}`)

      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error('Failed to fetch posts')
      }

      const posts: Post[] = await response.json()
      const hasNextPage = posts.length === limit

      return {
        items: posts,
        cursor: hasNextPage ? page + 1 : undefined,
      }
    },
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        Loaded {list().items.length} posts
        {list().cursor && ` (more available)`}
      </div>

      {list().cursor && (
        <button onClick={() => list().loadMore()} disabled={list().loading}>
          {list().loading ? 'Loading...' : 'Load More'}
        </button>
      )}

      {list().error && <div>Error: {list().error.message}</div>}

      <div>
        <For each={list().items}>
          {(post, index) => (
            <div>
              <div>
                <strong>{index() + 1}: </strong>
                <strong>{post.title}</strong>
              </div>
              <div>{post.body}</div>
            </div>
          )}
        </For>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Filtering

Filter data based on user input with automatic debouncing and loading states.

```tsx
import { useAsyncList } from '@ark-ui/solid/collection'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

interface User {
  id: number
  name: string
  email: string
  department: string
  role: string
}

export const Filter = () => {
  const list = useAsyncList<User>({
    initialItems: mockUsers.slice(0, 5),
    async load({ filterText }: { filterText?: string }) {
      await delay(500)

      if (!filterText) {
        return { items: mockUsers.slice(0, 5) }
      }

      const filtered = mockUsers.filter(
        (user) =>
          user.name.toLowerCase().includes(filterText.toLowerCase()) ||
          user.email.toLowerCase().includes(filterText.toLowerCase()),
      )

      return { items: filtered }
    },
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <input
          type="text"
          placeholder="Search users..."
          value={list().filterText}
          onInput={(e) => list().setFilterText(e.target.value)}
        />
        {list().loading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      </div>

      {list().error && <div>Error: {list().error.message}</div>}

      <div>
        <For each={list().items}>
          {(user) => (
            <div>
              <div>
                <strong>{user.name}</strong>
              </div>
              <div>{user.email}</div>
              <div>
                {user.department} • {user.role}
              </div>
            </div>
          )}
        </For>
      </div>

      {list().items.length === 0 && !list().loading && <div>No results found</div>}
    </div>
  )
}

const delay = (ms: number) => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms))

const mockUsers: User[] = [

### Sorting (Client-side)

Sort data on the client side after loading from the server.

```tsx
import { useAsyncList } from '@ark-ui/solid/collection'
import { useCollator } from '@ark-ui/solid/locale'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

interface User {
  id: number
  name: string
  username: string
  email: string
  phone: string
  website: string
}

export const SortClientSide = () => {
  const collator = useCollator()

  const list = useAsyncList<User>({
    autoReload: true,
    load: async () => {
      const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users')
      const data = await response.json()
      return { items: data }
    },
    sort({ items, descriptor }) {
      return {
        items: items.sort((a, b) => {
          const { column, direction } = descriptor
          let cmp = collator().compare(String(a[column]), String(b[column]))
          if (direction === 'descending') {
            cmp *= -1
          }
          return cmp
        }),
      }
    },
  })

  const handleSort = (column: keyof User) => {
    const currentSort = list().sortDescriptor
    let direction: 'ascending' | 'descending' = 'ascending'

    if (currentSort?.column === column && currentSort.direction === 'ascending') {
      direction = 'descending'
    }

    list().sort({ column, direction })
  }

  const getSortIcon = (column: keyof User) => {
    const current = list().sortDescriptor
    if (current?.column !== column) return '↕️'
    return current.direction === 'ascending' ? '↑' : '↓'
  }

  const descriptor = () => list().sortDescriptor

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        {list().loading && <div>Loading...</div>}
        {list().error && <div>Error: {list().error.message}</div>}
      </div>
      <div>Sorted by: {descriptor() ? `${descriptor()?.column} (${descriptor()?.direction})` : 'none'}</div>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <For
              each={[
                { key: 'name', label: 'Name' },
                { key: 'username', label: 'Username' },
                { key: 'email', label: 'Email' },
                { key: 'phone', label: 'Phone' },
                { key: 'website', label: 'Website' },
              ]}
            >
              {({ key, label }) => (
                <th onClick={() => handleSort(key as keyof User)}>
                  {label} {getSortIcon(key as keyof User)}
                </th>
              )}
            </For>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <For each={list().items}>
            {(user) => (
              <tr>
                <td>{user.name}</td>
                <td>{user.username}</td>
                <td>{user.email}</td>
                <td>{user.phone}</td>
                <td>{user.website}</td>
              </tr>
            )}
          </For>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Sorting (Server-side)

Send sort parameters to the server and reload data when sorting changes.

```tsx
import { useAsyncList } from '@ark-ui/solid/collection'
import { For, Show } from 'solid-js'

interface Product {
  id: number
  title: string
  price: number
  description: string
  category: string
  image: string
  rating: {
    rate: number
    count: number
  }
}

export const SortServerSide = () => {
  const list = useAsyncList<Product>({
    autoReload: true,
    async load({ sortDescriptor }) {
      const url = new URL('https://fakestoreapi.com/products')
      if (sortDescriptor) {
        const { direction } = sortDescriptor
        url.searchParams.set('sort', direction === 'ascending' ? 'asc' : 'desc')
      }
      const response = await fetch(url)
      const items = await response.json()
      return { items }
    },
  })

  const handleSort = (column: keyof Product) => {
    const currentSort = list().sortDescriptor
    let direction: 'ascending' | 'descending' = 'ascending'
    if (currentSort?.column === column && currentSort.direction === 'ascending') {
      direction = 'descending'
    }
    list().sort({ column, direction })
  }

  const getSortIcon = (column: keyof Product) => {
    const desc = list().sortDescriptor
    if (desc?.column !== column) return '↕️'
    return desc.direction === 'ascending' ? '↑' : '↓'
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <Show when={list().loading}>
        <div>Loading...</div>
      </Show>
      <Show when={list().error}>{(err) => <div>Error: {err().message}</div>}</Show>

      <button onClick={() => handleSort('title')}>Sort title {getSortIcon('title')}</button>

      <div>
        <For each={list().items}>
          {(product) => (
            <div>
              <div>{product.title}</div>
              <div>${product.price}</div>
              <div>{product.category}</div>
              <div>
                {product.rating.rate} ({product.rating.count} reviews)
              </div>
            </div>
          )}
        </For>
      </div>

      <Show when={list().sortDescriptor}>
        {(desc) => (
          <div>
            Sorted by {desc().column} ({desc().direction})
          </div>
        )}
      </Show>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Dependencies

Automatically reload data when dependencies change, such as filter selections or external state.

```tsx
import { useAsyncList } from '@ark-ui/solid/collection'
import { createSignal, For } from 'solid-js'

interface User {
  id: number
  name: string
  email: string
  department: string
  role: string
}

export const Dependencies = () => {
  const [selectedDepartment, setSelectedDepartment] = createSignal<string>('')
  const [selectedRole, setSelectedRole] = createSignal<string>('')

  const list = useAsyncList<User>({
    initialItems: mockUsers,
    get dependencies() {
      return [selectedDepartment(), selectedRole()]
    },
    async load({ filterText }: { filterText?: string }) {
      await delay(400)

      let items = mockUsers

      if (selectedDepartment()) {
        items = items.filter((user) => user.department === selectedDepartment())
      }

      if (selectedRole()) {
        items = items.filter((user) => user.role === selectedRole())
      }

      if (filterText) {
        items = items.filter(
          (user) =>
            user.name.toLowerCase().includes(filterText.toLowerCase()) ||
            user.email.toLowerCase().includes(filterText.toLowerCase()),
        )
      }

      return { items }
    },
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Dependencies Example</h2>

      <div>
        <select value={selectedDepartment()} onChange={(e) => setSelectedDepartment(e.target.value)}>
          <option value="">All Departments</option>
          <For each={departments}>{(dept) => <option value={dept}>{dept}</option>}</For>
        </select>

        <select value={selectedRole()} onChange={(e) => setSelectedRole(e.target.value)}>
          <option value="">All Roles</option>
          <For each={roles}>{(role) => <option value={role}>{role}</option>}</For>
        </select>

        <input
          type="text"
          placeholder="Search..."
          value={list().filterText}
          onInput={(e) => list().setFilterText(e.target.value)}
        />

        {list().loading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      </div>

      {list().error && <div>Error: {list().error.message}</div>}

      <div>Found {list().items.length} users</div>

      <div>
        <For each={list().items}>
          {(user) => (
            <div>
              <div>
                <strong>{user.name}</strong>
              </div>
              <div>{user.email}</div>
              <div>
                {user.department} • {user.role}
              </div>
            </div>
          )}
        </For>

# List Collection

A list collection is a collection that is based on an array of items. It is created by passing an array of items to the
constructor.

```ts
import { createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/collection'

const collection = createListCollection({
  items: [
    { label: 'Apple', value: 'apple' },
    { label: 'Banana', value: 'banana' },
  ],
})

console.log(collection.items) // [{ label: 'Apple', value: 'apple' }, { label: 'Banana', value: 'banana' }]
```

### Converting value to item

Use the `find` or `findMany` method to convert a value to an item.

```ts
const item = collection.find('banana')

console.log(item) // { label: "Banana", value: "banana" }

const items = collection.findMany(['apple', 'banana'])

console.log(items) // [{ label: "Apple", value: "apple" }, { label: "Banana", value: "banana" }]
```

### Value Traversal

Use the `getNextValue` or `getPreviousValue` method to get the next or previous item based on a value.

```ts
const nextValue = collection.getNextValue('apple')

console.log(nextValue) // banana

const previousItem = collection.getPreviousValue('banana')

console.log(previousItem) // apple
```

Likewise, use the `firstValue` or `lastValue` computed properties to get the first or last item.

```ts
console.log(collection.firstValue) // apple

console.log(collection.lastValue) // banana
```

### Check for value existence

Use the `has` method to check if a value exists in the collection.

```ts
const hasValue = collection.has('apple')

console.log(hasValue) // true
```

### Working with custom objects

If you are working with custom objects, you can pass a function to the `itemToString` and `itemToValue` options to
specify how to convert an item to a string and a value, respectively.

> By default, we look for the `label` and `value` properties in the item.

```ts
import { createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/collection'

const collection = createListCollection({
  items: [
    { id: 1, name: 'apple' },
    { id: 2, name: 'banana' },
    { id: 3, name: 'cherry' },
  ],
  itemToString: (item) => item.name,
  itemToValue: (item) => item.id,
})
```

To mark an item as disabled, pass a function to the `isItemDisabled` option.

> By default, we look for the `disabled` property in the item.

```ts
import { createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/collection'

const collection = createListCollection({
  items: [
    { id: 1, name: 'apple' },
    { id: 2, name: 'banana' },
    { id: 3, name: 'cherry' },
  ],
  isItemDisabled: (item) => item.id === 2,
})
```

### Reorder items

Use the `reorder` method to reorder items by passing the starting index and the ending index of the item to be moved.

```ts
const fromIndex = 1 // Banana
const toIndex = 0 // Apple
collection.reorder(fromIndex, toIndex)

console.log(collection.items) // [{ label: "Banana", value: "banana" }, { label: "Apple", value: "apple" }]
```


# List Selection

The `useListSelection` hook manages selection state in lists and collections. It supports single and multiple selection
modes with operations like select, deselect, toggle, and clear.

```tsx
import { createListCollection, useListSelection } from '@ark-ui/react/collection'

const collection = createListCollection({
  items: [
    { label: 'Apple', value: 'apple' },
    { label: 'Banana', value: 'banana' },
    { label: 'Cherry', value: 'cherry' },
  ],
})

const selection = useListSelection({
  collection,
  selectionMode: 'single',
  deselectable: true,
})

console.log(selection.selectedValues) // ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```

## Examples

### Basic

By default, the hook supports single selection mode that can be deselected.

> Set `deselectable` to `false` to prevent deselecting the current selection.

```tsx
import { createListCollection, useListSelection } from '@ark-ui/solid/collection'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

export const Basic = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({
    items: ['React', 'Vue', 'Angular'],
  })

  const selection = useListSelection({
    collection,
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(selection.selectedValues())}</pre>
      <For each={collection.items}>
        {(item) => (
          <label
            style={{
              display: 'flex',
              'align-items': 'center',
              gap: '8px',
              'user-select': 'none',
              'background-color': selection.isSelected(item) ? 'lightblue' : 'white',
            }}
          >
            <input type="checkbox" checked={selection.isSelected(item)} onChange={() => selection.select(item)} />
            <span>{item}</span>
          </label>
        )}
      </For>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Multiple Selection

Set `selectionMode` to `multiple` to allow multiple items to be selected.

```tsx
import { createListCollection, useListSelection } from '@ark-ui/solid/collection'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

export const Multiple = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({
    items: ['React', 'Vue', 'Angular', 'Svelte', 'Solid'],
  })

  const selection = useListSelection({
    collection,
    selectionMode: 'multiple',
  })

  const handleSelectAll = () => {
    if (selection.isAllSelected()) {
      selection.clear()
    } else {
      selection.setSelectedValues(collection.getValues())
    }
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <div style={{ 'margin-bottom': '16px', display: 'flex', 'align-items': 'center', gap: '16px' }}>
        <button onClick={handleSelectAll}>{selection.isAllSelected() ? 'Deselect All' : 'Select All'}</button>
        <span>
          {selection.selectedValues().length} of {collection.items.length} selected
        </span>
      </div>

      <For each={collection.items}>
        {(item) => (
          <label
            style={{
              display: 'flex',
              'align-items': 'center',
              gap: '8px',
              'user-select': 'none',
              'background-color': selection.isSelected(item) ? 'lightblue' : 'white',
            }}
          >
            <input type="checkbox" checked={selection.isSelected(item)} onChange={() => selection.select(item)} />
            <span>{item}</span>
          </label>
        )}
      </For>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Range Selection

Here's an example of how to implement range selection that extends the selection from the first selected item to the
clicked item.

```tsx
import { createListCollection, useListSelection } from '@ark-ui/solid/collection'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

export const Range = () => {
  const items = [
    { value: 'react', label: 'React' },
    { value: 'vue', label: 'Vue' },
    { value: 'angular', label: 'Angular' },
    { value: 'svelte', label: 'Svelte' },
    { value: 'solid', label: 'Solid' },
    { value: 'preact', label: 'Preact' },
    { value: 'qwik', label: 'Qwik' },
    { value: 'lit', label: 'Lit' },
  ]

  const collection = createListCollection({ items })
  const selection = useListSelection({
    collection,
    selectionMode: 'multiple',
  })

  const handleItemClick = (value: string, event: MouseEvent) => {
    const firstSelectedValue = selection.firstSelectedValue()
    if (event.shiftKey && firstSelectedValue) {
      // Extend selection from first selected to clicked item
      selection.extend(firstSelectedValue, value)
    } else if (event.ctrlKey || event.metaKey) {
      // Toggle individual item
      selection.toggle(value)
    } else {
      // Replace selection with clicked item
      selection.replace(value)
    }
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <div style={{ 'margin-bottom': '16px' }}>
        <p>
          <strong>Instructions:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul style={{ margin: '8px 0', 'padding-left': '20px' }}>
          <li>Click to select single item</li>
          <li>Ctrl/Cmd + Click to toggle individual items</li>
          <li>Shift + Click to select range from first selected item</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <For each={collection.items}>
        {(item) => (
          <label
            style={{
              'background-color': selection.isSelected(item.value) ? '#e2e8f0' : 'transparent',
              padding: '8px 12px',
              cursor: 'pointer',
              'user-select': 'none',
              border: '1px solid #e2e8f0',
              'margin-bottom': '2px',
            }}
          >
            <input
              type="checkbox"
              checked={selection.isSelected(item.value)}
              onClick={(e) => handleItemClick(item.value, e)}
            />
            {item.label}
          </label>
        )}
      </For>
    </div>
  )
}
```

# Tree Collection

A tree collection is designed to manage hierarchical data structures like file systems, navigation menus, or
organization charts. It provides powerful methods for traversing, manipulating, and querying tree structures.

```ts
import { createTreeCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/collection'

const treeData = {
  value: 'root',
  label: 'Root',
  children: [
    {
      value: 'folder1',
      label: 'Folder 1',
      children: [
        { value: 'file1', label: 'File 1.txt' },
        { value: 'file2', label: 'File 2.txt' },
      ],
    },
    {
      value: 'folder2',
      label: 'Folder 2',
      children: [
        {
          value: 'subfolder1',
          label: 'Subfolder 1',
          children: [{ value: 'file3', label: 'File 3.txt' }],
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
}

const tree = createTreeCollection({ rootNode: treeData })
```

### Navigation Methods

The tree collection provides various methods to navigate through the hierarchical structure.

#### Getting First and Last Nodes

```ts
const firstNode = tree.getFirstNode()
console.log(firstNode?.value) // "folder1"

const lastNode = tree.getLastNode()
console.log(lastNode?.value) // "folder2"
```

#### Sequential Navigation

Navigate to the next or previous node in the tree traversal order:

```ts
const nextNode = tree.getNextNode('file1')
console.log(nextNode?.value) // "file2"

const previousNode = tree.getPreviousNode('file2')
console.log(previousNode?.value) // "file1"
```

### Hierarchical Relationships

#### Parent and Children

Get parent and descendant nodes:

```ts
// Get parent node
const parentNode = tree.getParentNode('file1')
console.log(parentNode?.value) // "folder1"

// Get all ancestor nodes
const ancestors = tree.getParentNodes('file3')
console.log(ancestors.map((n) => n.value)) // ["folder2", "subfolder1"]

// Get all descendant nodes
const descendants = tree.getDescendantNodes('folder1')
console.log(descendants.map((n) => n.value)) // ["file1", "file2"]

// Get descendant values only
const descendantValues = tree.getDescendantValues('folder2')
console.log(descendantValues) // ["subfolder1", "file3"]
```

#### Sibling Navigation

Navigate between sibling nodes:

```ts
// Assuming we have the index path of "file1"
const indexPath = tree.getIndexPath('file1') // [0, 0]

const nextSibling = tree.getNextSibling(indexPath)
console.log(nextSibling?.value) // "file2"

const previousSibling = tree.getPreviousSibling(indexPath)
console.log(previousSibling) // undefined (no previous sibling)

// Get all siblings
const siblings = tree.getSiblingNodes(indexPath)
console.log(siblings.map((n) => n.value)) // ["file1", "file2"]
```

### Index Path Operations

Work with index paths to identify node positions:

```ts
// Get index path for a value
const indexPath = tree.getIndexPath('file3')
console.log(indexPath) // [1, 0, 0]

// Get value from index path
const value = tree.getValue([1, 0, 0])
console.log(value) // "file3"

// Get full value path (all ancestors + node)
const valuePath = tree.getValuePath([1, 0, 0])
console.log(valuePath) // ["folder2", "subfolder1", "file3"]

// Get node at specific index path
const node = tree.at([1, 0])
console.log(node?.value) // "subfolder1"
```

### Tree Queries

#### Branch and Leaf Detection

```ts
// Check if a node is a branch (has children)
const folder1Node = tree.findNode('folder1')
const isBranch = tree.isBranchNode(folder1Node!)
console.log(isBranch) // true

// Get all branch values
const branchValues = tree.getBranchValues()
console.log(branchValues) // ["folder1", "folder2", "subfolder1"]
```

#### Tree Traversal

Visit all nodes with custom logic:

```ts
tree.visit({
  onEnter: (node, indexPath) => {
    console.log(`Visiting: ${node.value} at depth ${indexPath.length}`)

    // Skip certain branches
    if (node.value === 'folder2') {
      return 'skip' // Skip this branch and its children
    }
  },
})
```

#### Filtering

Create a new tree with filtered nodes:

```ts
// Keep only nodes that match criteria
const filteredTree = tree.filter((node, indexPath) => {
  return node.value.includes('file') // Only keep files
})

console.log(filteredTree.getValues()) // ["file1", "file2", "file3"]
```

### Tree Manipulation

#### Adding Nodes

```ts
const newFile = { value: 'newfile', label: 'New File.txt' }

// Insert after a specific node
const indexPath = tree.getIndexPath('file1')
const updatedTree = tree.insertAfter(indexPath!, [newFile])

// Insert before a specific node
const updatedTree2 = tree.insertBefore(indexPath!, [newFile])
```

#### Removing Nodes

```ts
const indexPath = tree.getIndexPath('file2')
const updatedTree = tree.remove([indexPath!])

console.log(updatedTree.getValues()) // file2 is removed
```

#### Moving Nodes

```ts
const fromIndexPaths = [tree.getIndexPath('file1')!]
const toIndexPath = tree.getIndexPath('folder2')!

const updatedTree = tree.move(fromIndexPaths, toIndexPath)
// file1 is now moved under folder2
```

#### Replacing Nodes

```ts
const indexPath = tree.getIndexPath('file1')!
const newNode = { value: 'replacedfile', label: 'Replaced File.txt' }

const updatedTree = tree.replace(indexPath, newNode)
```

### Utility Methods

#### Flattening

Convert the tree to a flat structure:

```ts
const flatNodes = tree.flatten()
console.log(flatNodes.map((n) => ({ value: n.value, depth: n._indexPath.length })))
// [{ value: "folder1", depth: 1 }, { value: "file1", depth: 2 }, ...]
```

#### Getting All Values

```ts
const allValues = tree.getValues()
console.log(allValues) // ["folder1", "file1", "file2", "folder2", "subfolder1", "file3"]
```

#### Depth Calculation

```ts
const depth = tree.getDepth('file3')
console.log(depth) // 3 (root -> folder2 -> subfolder1 -> file3)
```

### Working with Custom Node Types

You can customize how the tree collection interprets your data:

```ts
interface CustomNode {
  id: string
  name: string
  items?: CustomNode[]
  isDisabled?: boolean
}

const customTree = createTreeCollection<CustomNode>({
  rootNode: {
    id: 'root',
    name: 'Root',
    items: [
      { id: '1', name: 'Item 1', isDisabled: false },
      { id: '2', name: 'Item 2', isDisabled: true },
    ],
  },
  nodeToValue: (node) => node.id,
  nodeToString: (node) => node.name,
  nodeToChildren: (node) => node.items,
  isNodeDisabled: (node) => node.isDisabled ?? false,
})
```

### Creating Trees from File Paths

Create a tree structure from file paths:

```ts
import { createFileTreeCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/collection'

const paths = ['src/components/Button.tsx', 'src/components/Input.tsx', 'src/utils/helpers.ts', 'docs/README.md']

const fileTree = createFileTreeCollection(paths)
console.log(fileTree.getBranchValues()) // ["src", "components", "utils", "docs"]
```

> **Good to know**: Tree collections are immutable - all modification methods return a new tree instance rather than
> modifying the original.



# COMPONENTS

---

# Accordion



## Features

- Full keyboard navigation
- Supports horizontal and vertical orientation
- Right-to-Left (RTL) support
- Single or multiple item expansion
- Controlled and uncontrolled modes
- Collapse each accordion item

## Anatomy

To set up the accordion correctly, it's essential to understand its anatomy and the naming of its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



## Examples

### Default Expanded State

Set the `defaultValue` prop to specify which item should be expanded by default.

```tsx
import { Accordion } from '@ark-ui/solid/accordion'
import { ChevronDownIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const Basic = () => {
  return (
    <Accordion.Root defaultValue={['React']}>
      <Index each={['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte']}>
        {(item) => (
          <Accordion.Item value={item()}>
            <Accordion.ItemTrigger>
              What is {item()}?
              <Accordion.ItemIndicator>
                <ChevronDownIcon />
              </Accordion.ItemIndicator>
            </Accordion.ItemTrigger>
            <Accordion.ItemContent>
              {item()} is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
            </Accordion.ItemContent>
          </Accordion.Item>
        )}
      </Index>
    </Accordion.Root>
  )
}
```

### Collapsible

Use the `collapsible` prop to allow the user to collapse all panels.

```tsx
import { Accordion } from '@ark-ui/solid/accordion'
import { ChevronDownIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const Collapsible = () => {
  return (
    <Accordion.Root defaultValue={['React']} collapsible>
      <Index each={['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte']}>
        {(item) => (
          <Accordion.Item value={item()}>
            <Accordion.ItemTrigger>
              What is {item()}?
              <Accordion.ItemIndicator>
                <ChevronDownIcon />
              </Accordion.ItemIndicator>
            </Accordion.ItemTrigger>
            <Accordion.ItemContent>
              {item()} is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
            </Accordion.ItemContent>
          </Accordion.Item>
        )}
      </Index>
    </Accordion.Root>
  )
}
```

### Multiple Panels

Use the `multiple` prop to allow multiple panels to be expanded simultaneously.

```tsx
import { Accordion } from '@ark-ui/solid/accordion'
import { ChevronDownIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const Multiple = () => {
  return (
    <Accordion.Root defaultValue={['React']} multiple>
      <Index each={['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte']}>
        {(item) => (
          <Accordion.Item value={item()}>
            <Accordion.ItemTrigger>
              What is {item()}?
              <Accordion.ItemIndicator>
                <ChevronDownIcon />
              </Accordion.ItemIndicator>
            </Accordion.ItemTrigger>
            <Accordion.ItemContent>
              {item()} is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
            </Accordion.ItemContent>
          </Accordion.Item>
        )}
      </Index>
    </Accordion.Root>
  )
}
```

### Horizontal Orientation

By default, the Accordion is oriented vertically. Use the `orientation` prop to switch to a horizontal layout.

```tsx
import { Accordion } from '@ark-ui/solid/accordion'
import { ChevronDownIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const Horizontal = () => {
  return (
    <Accordion.Root defaultValue={['React']} orientation="horizontal">
      <Index each={['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte']}>
        {(item) => (
          <Accordion.Item value={item()}>
            <Accordion.ItemTrigger>
              What is {item()}?
              <Accordion.ItemIndicator>
                <ChevronDownIcon />
              </Accordion.ItemIndicator>
            </Accordion.ItemTrigger>
            <Accordion.ItemContent>
              {item()} is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
            </Accordion.ItemContent>
          </Accordion.Item>
        )}
      </Index>
    </Accordion.Root>
  )
}
```

### Animate Content Size

Use the `--height` and/or `--width` CSS variables to animate the size of the content when it expands or closes:

```css
@keyframes slideDown {
  from {
    opacity: 0.01;
    height: 0;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    height: var(--height);
  }
}

@keyframes slideUp {
  from {
    opacity: 1;
    height: var(--height);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 0.01;
    height: 0;
  }
}

[data-scope='accordion'][data-part='item-content'][data-state='open'] {
  animation: slideDown 250ms ease-in-out;
}

[data-scope='accordion'][data-part='item-content'][data-state='closed'] {
  animation: slideUp 200ms ease-in-out;
}
```

### Using the Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the accordion. It accepts the value of the `useAccordion` hook. You
can leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the accordion.

```tsx
import { Accordion, useAccordion } from '@ark-ui/solid/accordion'
import { ChevronDownIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const accordion = useAccordion({
    multiple: true,
    defaultValue: ['React'],
  })

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => accordion().setValue(['Vue'])}>Set to Vue</button>

      <Accordion.RootProvider value={accordion}>
        <Index each={['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte']}>
          {(item) => (
            <Accordion.Item value={item()}>
              <Accordion.ItemTrigger>
                What is {item()}?
                <Accordion.ItemIndicator>
                  <ChevronDownIcon />
                </Accordion.ItemIndicator>
              </Accordion.ItemTrigger>
              <Accordion.ItemContent>
                {item()} is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
              </Accordion.ItemContent>
            </Accordion.Item>
          )}
        </Index>
      </Accordion.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

### Accessing context

Use the `Accordion.Context` component or `useAccordionContext` hook to access the state of an accordion. It exposes the
following properties:

- `focusedValue`: The value of the focused accordion item.
- `value`: The value of the selected accordion items.
- `setValue`: A method to set the selected accordion items.

```tsx
import { Accordion } from '@ark-ui/solid/accordion'
import { ChevronDownIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const Context = () => {
  return (
    <Accordion.Root defaultValue={['React']}>
      <Accordion.Context>
        {(context) => (
          <div>
            <span>Selected items: {context().value.join(', ')}</span>
            <span>Focused item: {context().focusedValue}</span>
            <button onClick={() => context().setValue(['React', 'Solid'])}>Set value</button>
          </div>
        )}
      </Accordion.Context>

      <Index each={['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte']}>
        {(item) => (
          <Accordion.Item value={item()}>
            <Accordion.ItemTrigger>
              What is {item()}?
              <Accordion.ItemIndicator>
                <ChevronDownIcon />
              </Accordion.ItemIndicator>
            </Accordion.ItemTrigger>
            <Accordion.ItemContent>
              {item()} is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
            </Accordion.ItemContent>
          </Accordion.Item>
        )}
      </Index>
    </Accordion.Root>
  )
}
```

### Accessing the item context

Use the `Accordion.ItemContext` component or `useAccordionItemContext` hook to access the state of an accordion item. It
exposes the following properties:

- `expanded`: Whether the accordion item is expanded.
- `focused`: Whether the accordion item is focused.
- `disabled`: Whether the accordion item is disabled.

```tsx
import { Accordion } from '@ark-ui/solid/accordion'
import { ChevronDownIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const ItemContext = () => {
  return (
    <Accordion.Root defaultValue={['React']}>
      <Index each={['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte']}>
        {(item) => (
          <Accordion.Item value={item()}>
            <Accordion.ItemTrigger>
              What is {item()}?
              <Accordion.ItemIndicator>
                <ChevronDownIcon />
              </Accordion.ItemIndicator>
              <Accordion.ItemContext>
                {(context) => (
                  <div style={{ display: 'inline-flex', gap: '0.5rem' }}>
                    <span>Expanded: {String(context().expanded)}</span>
                    <span>Focused: {String(context().focused)}</span>
                    <span>Disabled: {String(context().disabled)}</span>
                  </div>
                )}
              </Accordion.ItemContext>
            </Accordion.ItemTrigger>
            <Accordion.ItemContent>
              {item()} is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
            </Accordion.ItemContent>
          </Accordion.Item>
        )}
      </Index>
    </Accordion.Root>
  )
}
```

# Avatar



## Anatomy

To set up the avatar correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



## Examples

Learn how to use the `Avatar` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

```tsx
import { Avatar } from '@ark-ui/solid/avatar'

export const Basic = () => (
  <Avatar.Root>
    <Avatar.Fallback>PA</Avatar.Fallback>
    <Avatar.Image src="https://i.pravatar.cc/300" alt="avatar" />
  </Avatar.Root>
)
```

### Handling Events

Use `onStatusChange` to listen for loading state changes.

```tsx
import { Avatar } from '@ark-ui/solid/avatar'

export const Events = () => {
  const handleStatusChange = (details: Avatar.StatusChangeDetails) => {
    console.log(details.status)
  }

  return (
    <Avatar.Root onStatusChange={handleStatusChange}>
      <Avatar.Fallback>PA</Avatar.Fallback>
      <Avatar.Image src="https://i.pravatar.cc/3000" alt="avatar" />
    </Avatar.Root>
  )
}
```

### Root Provider

Use the `useAvatar` hook to create the avatar store and pass it to the `Avatar.RootProvider` component. This allows you
to have maximum control over the avatar programmatically.

```tsx
import { Avatar, useAvatar } from '@ark-ui/solid/avatar'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const avatar = useAvatar()

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => avatar().setSrc('https://new-source.com')}>Change Source</button>

      <Avatar.RootProvider value={avatar}>
        <Avatar.Fallback>PA</Avatar.Fallback>
        <Avatar.Image src="https://i.pravatar.cc/300" alt="avatar" />
      </Avatar.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

> If you're using the `Avatar.RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Avatar.Root` component.

Here's an example of how to use the `Image` component from `next/image`.

```tsx
import { Avatar, useAvatarContext } from '@ark-ui/react/avatar'
import { getImageProps, type ImageProps } from 'next/image'

const AvatarNextImage = (props: ImageProps) => {
  const avatar = useAvatarContext()

  const { hidden, ...arkImageProps } = avatar.getImageProps()
  const nextImage = getImageProps(props)

  return (
    <img
      {...arkImageProps}
      {...nextImage.props}
      style={{
        ...props.style,
        // use visibility instead
        visibility: hidden ? 'hidden' : 'visible',
      }}
    />
  )
}

const Demo = () => {
  return (
    <Avatar.Root>
      <Avatar.Fallback>JD</Avatar.Fallback>
      <AvatarNextImage src="..." alt="" width={80} height={80} />
    </Avatar.Root>
  )
}
```

# Carousel



## Features

- Native CSS Scroll Snap integration for smooth, performant animations
- Flexible orientation support (horizontal and vertical layouts)
- Customizable slide alignment (start, center, or end positions)
- Multi-slide display capabilities for complex layouts
- Automatic playback with configurable looping behavior
- Adjustable slide spacing and gap controls

## Anatomy

To set up the carousel correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



## Examples

Learn how to use the `Carousel` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

```tsx
import { Carousel } from '@ark-ui/solid/carousel'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

const images = Array.from({ length: 5 }, (_, i) => `https://picsum.photos/seed/${i + 1}/500/300`)

export const Basic = () => {
  return (
    <Carousel.Root slideCount={images.length}>
      <Carousel.Control>
        <Carousel.PrevTrigger>Previous</Carousel.PrevTrigger>
        <Carousel.NextTrigger>Next</Carousel.NextTrigger>
      </Carousel.Control>
      <Carousel.IndicatorGroup>
        <Index each={images}>{(_, index) => <Carousel.Indicator index={index} />}</Index>
      </Carousel.IndicatorGroup>
      <Carousel.ItemGroup>
        <Index each={images}>
          {(image, index) => (
            <Carousel.Item index={index}>
              <img src={image()} alt={`Slide ${index}`} />
            </Carousel.Item>
          )}
        </Index>
      </Carousel.ItemGroup>
    </Carousel.Root>
  )
}
```

### Controlled

To create a controlled Carousel component, you can manage the state of the carousel using the `page` prop and update it
when the `onPageChange` event handler is called:

```tsx
import { Carousel } from '@ark-ui/solid/carousel'
import { Index, createSignal } from 'solid-js'

const images = Array.from({ length: 5 }, (_, i) => `https://picsum.photos/seed/${i + 1}/500/300`)

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [page, setPage] = createSignal(0)

  return (
    <Carousel.Root slideCount={images.length} page={page()} onPageChange={(details) => setPage(details.page)}>
      <Carousel.Control>
        <Carousel.PrevTrigger>Previous</Carousel.PrevTrigger>
        <Carousel.NextTrigger>Next</Carousel.NextTrigger>
      </Carousel.Control>
      <Carousel.IndicatorGroup>
        <Index each={images}>{(_, index) => <Carousel.Indicator index={index} />}</Index>
      </Carousel.IndicatorGroup>
      <Carousel.ItemGroup>
        <Index each={images}>
          {(image, index) => (
            <Carousel.Item index={index}>
              <img src={image()} alt={`Slide ${index}`} />
            </Carousel.Item>
          )}
        </Index>
      </Carousel.ItemGroup>
    </Carousel.Root>
  )
}
```

### Root Provider

Use the `useCarousel` hook to create the carousel store and pass it to the `Carousel.RootProvider` component. This
allows you to have maximum control over the carousel programmatically.

```tsx
import { Carousel, useCarousel } from '@ark-ui/solid/carousel'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

const images = Array.from({ length: 5 }, (_, i) => `https://picsum.photos/seed/${i + 1}/500/300`)

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const carousel = useCarousel({ slideCount: images.length })
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => carousel().scrollToIndex(2)}>Scroll to #3</button>
      <Carousel.RootProvider value={carousel}>
        <Carousel.Control>
          <Carousel.PrevTrigger>Previous</Carousel.PrevTrigger>
          <Carousel.NextTrigger>Next</Carousel.NextTrigger>
        </Carousel.Control>
        <Carousel.IndicatorGroup>
          <Index each={images}>{(_, index) => <Carousel.Indicator index={index} />}</Index>
        </Carousel.IndicatorGroup>
        <Carousel.ItemGroup>
          <Index each={images}>
            {(image, index) => (
              <Carousel.Item index={index}>
                <img src={image()} alt={`Slide ${index}`} />
              </Carousel.Item>
            )}
          </Index>
        </Carousel.ItemGroup>
      </Carousel.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

> If you're using the `Carousel.RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Carousel.Root` component.

### Autoplay

Pass the `autoplay` and `loop` props to `Carousel.Root` to make the carousel play automatically.

> **Note:** Adding `loop` ensures the carousel keeps going after the last slide.

```tsx
import { Carousel } from '@ark-ui/solid/carousel'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

const images = Array.from({ length: 5 }, (_, i) => `https://picsum.photos/seed/${i + 1}/500/300`)

export const Autoplay = () => {
  return (
    <Carousel.Root slideCount={images.length} autoplay loop>
      <Carousel.Control>
        <Carousel.AutoplayTrigger>
          <Carousel.Context>{(carousel) => (carousel().isPlaying ? 'Pause' : 'Play')}</Carousel.Context>
        </Carousel.AutoplayTrigger>
      </Carousel.Control>
      <Carousel.IndicatorGroup>
        <Index each={images}>{(_, index) => <Carousel.Indicator index={index} />}</Index>
      </Carousel.IndicatorGroup>
      <Carousel.ItemGroup>
        <Index each={images}>
          {(image, index) => (
            <Carousel.Item index={index}>
              <img src={image()} alt={`Slide ${index}`} />
            </Carousel.Item>
          )}
        </Index>
      </Carousel.ItemGroup>
    </Carousel.Root>
  )
}
```

### Pause on Hover

This feature isn't built-in, but you can use the `play()` and `pause()` methods from `Carousel.Context` to implement
pause on hover.

Add the `autoplay` and `loop` props to `Carousel.Root`, then attach `onPointerOver` and `onPointerLeave` handlers to
`Carousel.ItemGroup` that call `api.pause()` and `api.play()` respectively.

```tsx
import { Carousel } from '@ark-ui/solid/carousel'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

const images = Array.from({ length: 5 }, (_, i) => `https://picsum.photos/seed/${i + 1}/500/300`)

export const PauseOnHover = () => {
  return (
    <Carousel.Root slideCount={images.length} autoplay loop>
      <Carousel.Control>
        <Carousel.Context>
          {(carousel) => `Autoplay is: ${carousel().isPlaying ? 'playing' : 'paused'}`}
        </Carousel.Context>
      </Carousel.Control>
      <Carousel.Context>
        {(api) => (
          <Carousel.ItemGroup onPointerOver={() => api().pause()} onPointerLeave={() => api().play()}>
            <Index each={images}>
              {(image, index) => (
                <Carousel.Item index={index}>
                  <img src={image()} alt={`Slide ${index}`} />
                </Carousel.Item>
              )}
            </Index>
          </Carousel.ItemGroup>
        )}
      </Carousel.Context>
      <Carousel.IndicatorGroup>
        <Index each={images}>{(_, index) => <Carousel.Indicator index={index} />}</Index>
      </Carousel.IndicatorGroup>
    </Carousel.Root>
  )
}
```

### Custom Indicators

Replace default indicator dots with custom content by wrapping `Carousel.IndicatorGroup` in `Carousel.Context`. Use
`api.page` to determine the active indicator and render image thumbnails for each slide:

```tsx
import { Carousel } from '@ark-ui/solid/carousel'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

const images = Array.from({ length: 5 }, (_, i) => `https://picsum.photos/seed/${i + 1}/500/300`)

export const CustomIndicator = () => {
  return (
    <Carousel.Root slideCount={images.length}>
      <Carousel.Control>
        <Carousel.PrevTrigger>Previous</Carousel.PrevTrigger>
        <Carousel.NextTrigger>Next</Carousel.NextTrigger>
      </Carousel.Control>
      <Carousel.ItemGroup>
        <Index each={images}>
          {(image, index) => (
            <Carousel.Item index={index}>
              <img
                src={image()}
                alt={`Slide ${index}`}
                style={{ width: '100%', height: '300px', 'object-fit': 'cover' }}
              />
            </Carousel.Item>
          )}
        </Index>
      </Carousel.ItemGroup>
      <Carousel.Context>
        {(api) => (
          <Carousel.IndicatorGroup style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '8px', 'margin-top': '16px' }}>
            <Index each={images}>
              {(image, index) => (
                <Carousel.Indicator index={index}>
                  <img
                    src={image()}
                    alt={`Thumbnail ${index}`}
                    style={{
                      width: '60px',
                      height: '40px',
                      'object-fit': 'cover',
                      cursor: 'pointer',
                      border: api().page === index ? '2px solid #0066ff' : '2px solid transparent',
                      'border-radius': '4px',
                      opacity: api().page === index ? 1 : 0.6,
                      transition: 'all 0.2s',
                    }}
                  />
                </Carousel.Indicator>
              )}
            </Index>
          </Carousel.IndicatorGroup>
        )}
      </Carousel.Context>
    </Carousel.Root>
  )
}
```

### Vertical Orientation

Set the `orientation="vertical"` prop on `Carousel.Root` to change the carousel from horizontal to vertical scrolling.
This is useful for vertical galleries or content feeds.

```tsx
import { Carousel } from '@ark-ui/solid/carousel'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

const images = Array.from({ length: 5 }, (_, i) => `https://picsum.photos/seed/${i + 1}/500/300`)

export const Vertical = () => {
  return (
    <Carousel.Root orientation="vertical" slideCount={images.length}>
      <Carousel.Control>
        <Carousel.PrevTrigger>Previous</Carousel.PrevTrigger>
        <Carousel.NextTrigger>Next</Carousel.NextTrigger>
      </Carousel.Control>
      <Carousel.IndicatorGroup>
        <Index each={images}>{(_, index) => <Carousel.Indicator index={index} />}</Index>
      </Carousel.IndicatorGroup>
      <Carousel.ItemGroup>
        <Index each={images}>
          {(image, index) => (
            <Carousel.Item index={index}>
              <img src={image()} alt={`Slide ${index}`} />
            </Carousel.Item>
          )}
        </Index>
      </Carousel.ItemGroup>
    </Carousel.Root>
  )
}
```

### Dynamic Slides

Manage slides dynamically by storing them in state and syncing the carousel page. Pass the `page` prop and
`onPageChange` handler to `Carousel.Root`, and update `slideCount` when slides are added or removed. This demonstrates
bidirectional state synchronization between your component state and the carousel.

```tsx
import { Carousel } from '@ark-ui/solid/carousel'
import { Index, createSignal } from 'solid-js'

export const DynamicSlides = () => {
  const [slides, setSlides] = createSignal([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
  const [page, setPage] = createSignal(0)

  const addSlide = () => {
    setSlides((prevSlides) => {
      const max = Math.max(...prevSlides)
      return [...prevSlides, max + 1]
    })
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <Carousel.Root slideCount={slides().length} page={page()} onPageChange={(details) => setPage(details.page)}>
        <Carousel.Control>
          <Carousel.PrevTrigger>Previous</Carousel.PrevTrigger>
          <Carousel.NextTrigger>Next</Carousel.NextTrigger>
        </Carousel.Control>
        <Carousel.IndicatorGroup>
          <Index each={slides()}>{(_, index) => <Carousel.Indicator index={index} />}</Index>
        </Carousel.IndicatorGroup>
        <Carousel.ItemGroup>
          <Index each={slides()}>
            {(slide, index) => (
              <Carousel.Item index={index}>
                <div
                  style={{
                    display: 'flex',
                    'align-items': 'center',
                    'justify-content': 'center',
                    width: '100%',
                    height: '300px',
                    'background-color': `hsl(${(slide() * 60) % 360}, 70%, 60%)`,
                    color: 'white',
                    'font-size': '24px',
                    'font-weight': 'bold',
                    'border-radius': '8px',
                  }}
                >
                  Slide {slide()}
                </div>
              </Carousel.Item>
            )}
          </Index>
        </Carousel.ItemGroup>
      </Carousel.Root>
      <button onClick={addSlide} style={{ 'margin-top': '16px', padding: '8px 16px', cursor: 'pointer' }}>
        Add Slide
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Scroll to Slide

Use `Carousel.Context` to access the carousel API and call `api.scrollToIndex(index)` to programmatically navigate to a
specific slide. This is useful for creating custom navigation or jump-to-slide functionality.

```tsx
import { Carousel } from '@ark-ui/solid/carousel'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const ScrollTo = () => {
  return (
    <Carousel.Root slideCount={5}>
      <Carousel.Context>
        {(api) => <button onClick={() => api().scrollToIndex(3)}>Go to slide 4</button>}
      </Carousel.Context>
      <Carousel.ItemGroup>
        <Index each={Array.from({ length: 5 })}>
          {(_, index) => (
            <Carousel.Item index={index}>
              <div
                style={{
                  display: 'flex',
                  'align-items': 'center',
                  'justify-content': 'center',
                  width: '100%',
                  height: '300px',
                  'background-color': '#f0f0f0',
                  'font-size': '24px',
                  'font-weight': 'bold',
                  'border-radius': '8px',
                }}
              >
                Slide {index + 1}
              </div>
            </Carousel.Item>
          )}
        </Index>
      </Carousel.ItemGroup>
      <Carousel.Control>
        <Carousel.PrevTrigger>Previous</Carousel.PrevTrigger>
        <Carousel.NextTrigger>Next</Carousel.NextTrigger>
      </Carousel.Control>
      <Carousel.IndicatorGroup>
        <Index each={Array.from({ length: 5 })}>{(_, index) => <Carousel.Indicator index={index} />}</Index>
      </Carousel.IndicatorGroup>
    </Carousel.Root>
  )
}
```

### Slides Per Page

Display multiple slides simultaneously by setting the `slidesPerPage` prop on `Carousel.Root`. Use `api.pageSnapPoints`
from `Carousel.Context` to render the correct number of indicators based on pages rather than individual slides. Add the
`spacing` prop to control the gap between slides.

```tsx
import { Carousel } from '@ark-ui/solid/carousel'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

const slides = Array.from({ length: 5 }, (_, i) => i)

export const SlidesPerPage = () => {
  return (
    <Carousel.Root slideCount={slides.length} slidesPerPage={2} spacing="20px">
      <Carousel.Control>
        <Carousel.PrevTrigger>Previous</Carousel.PrevTrigger>
        <Carousel.NextTrigger>Next</Carousel.NextTrigger>
      </Carousel.Control>
      <Carousel.ItemGroup>
        <Index each={slides}>
          {(_, index) => (
            <Carousel.Item index={index}>
              <div
                style={{
                  width: '100%',
                  height: '300px',
                  display: 'flex',
                  'align-items': 'center',
                  'justify-content': 'center',
                  background: '#f0f0f0',
                }}
              >
                Slide {index + 1}
              </div>
            </Carousel.Item>
          )}
        </Index>
      </Carousel.ItemGroup>
      <Carousel.Context>
        {(api) => (
          <Carousel.IndicatorGroup>
            <Index each={api().pageSnapPoints}>{(_, index) => <Carousel.Indicator index={index} />}</Index>
          </Carousel.IndicatorGroup>
        )}
      </Carousel.Context>
    </Carousel.Root>
  )
}
```

## Accessibility

Complies with the [Carousel WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/carousel/).


# Checkbox



## Anatomy

To set up the checkbox correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



### Design impact on the asChild property

The `Checkbox.Root` element of the checkbox is a `label` element. This is because the checkbox is a form control and
should be associated with a label to provide context and meaning to the user. Otherwise, the HTML and accessibility
structure will be invalid.

> If you need to use the `asChild` property, make sure that the `label` element is the direct child of the
> `Checkbox.Root` component.

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Checkbox` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/solid/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

export const Basic = () => (
  <Checkbox.Root>
    <Checkbox.Label>Checkbox</Checkbox.Label>
    <Checkbox.Control>
      <Checkbox.Indicator>
        <CheckIcon />
      </Checkbox.Indicator>
    </Checkbox.Control>
    <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
  </Checkbox.Root>
)
```

### Controlled

Use the `checked` and `onCheckedChange` props to programatically control the checkbox's state.

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/solid/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [checked, setChecked] = createSignal<Checkbox.CheckedState>(true)
  return (
    <Checkbox.Root checked={checked()} onCheckedChange={(e) => setChecked(e.checked)}>
      <Checkbox.Label>Checkbox</Checkbox.Label>
      <Checkbox.Control>
        <Checkbox.Indicator>
          <CheckIcon />
        </Checkbox.Indicator>
      </Checkbox.Control>
      <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
    </Checkbox.Root>
  )
}
```

### Default Checked

Use the `defaultChecked` prop to set the initial checked state in an uncontrolled manner. The checkbox will manage its
own state internally.

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/solid/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

export const DefaultChecked = () => (
  <Checkbox.Root defaultChecked>
    <Checkbox.Label>Checkbox</Checkbox.Label>
    <Checkbox.Control>
      <Checkbox.Indicator>
        <CheckIcon />
      </Checkbox.Indicator>
    </Checkbox.Control>
    <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
  </Checkbox.Root>
)
```

### Disabled

Use the `disabled` prop to make the checkbox non-interactive.

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/solid/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

export const Disabled = () => (
  <Checkbox.Root disabled>
    <Checkbox.Label>Accept terms and conditions</Checkbox.Label>
    <Checkbox.Control>
      <Checkbox.Indicator>
        <CheckIcon />
      </Checkbox.Indicator>
    </Checkbox.Control>
    <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
  </Checkbox.Root>
)
```

### Indeterminate

Use the `indeterminate` prop to create a checkbox in an indeterminate state (partially checked).

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/solid/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon, MinusIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

export const Indeterminate = () => (
  <Checkbox.Root defaultChecked="indeterminate">
    <Checkbox.Label>Checkbox</Checkbox.Label>
    <Checkbox.Control>
      <Checkbox.Indicator>
        <CheckIcon />
      </Checkbox.Indicator>
      <Checkbox.Indicator indeterminate>
        <MinusIcon />
      </Checkbox.Indicator>
    </Checkbox.Control>
    <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
  </Checkbox.Root>
)
```

### Programmatic Control

Use the `useCheckbox` hook with `setChecked()` to programmatically control the checkbox state.

```tsx
import { Checkbox, useCheckbox } from '@ark-ui/solid/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

export const ProgrammaticControl = () => {
  const checkbox = useCheckbox()

  return (
    <>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => checkbox().setChecked(true)}>
        Check
      </button>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => checkbox().setChecked(false)}>
        Uncheck
      </button>

      <Checkbox.RootProvider value={checkbox}>
        <Checkbox.Label>Checkbox</Checkbox.Label>
        <Checkbox.Control>
          <Checkbox.Indicator>
            <CheckIcon />
          </Checkbox.Indicator>
        </Checkbox.Control>
        <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
      </Checkbox.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Access Checkbox state

Use the `Checkbox.Context` and its render prop to access the checkbox's state and methods.

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/solid/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

export const RenderProp = () => (
  <Checkbox.Root>
    <Checkbox.Control>
      <Checkbox.Indicator>
        <CheckIcon />
      </Checkbox.Indicator>
    </Checkbox.Control>
    <Checkbox.Context>
      {(checkbox) => <Checkbox.Label>Checkbox {checkbox().checked.toString()}</Checkbox.Label>}
    </Checkbox.Context>
    <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
  </Checkbox.Root>
)
```

### Field

The checkbox integrates smoothly with the `Field` component to handle form state, helper text, and error text for proper
accessibility.

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/solid/checkbox'
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'
import { CheckIcon, MinusIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

export const WithField = (props: Field.RootProps) => (
  <Field.Root {...props}>
    <Checkbox.Root>
      <Checkbox.Label>Label</Checkbox.Label>
      <Checkbox.Control>
        <Checkbox.Indicator>
          <CheckIcon />
        </Checkbox.Indicator>
        <Checkbox.Indicator indeterminate>
          <MinusIcon />
        </Checkbox.Indicator>
      </Checkbox.Control>
      <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
    </Checkbox.Root>
    <Field.HelperText>Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
)
```

### Form

Pass the `name` and `value` props to the `Checkbox.Root` component to make the checkbox part of a form. The checkbox's
value will be submitted with the form when the user submits it.

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/solid/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

const handleSubmit = (event: Event) => {
  event.preventDefault()
  const formData = new FormData(event.target as HTMLFormElement)
  console.log('terms:', formData.get('terms'))
}

export const WithForm = () => (
  <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
    <Checkbox.Root name="terms" value="accepted">
      <Checkbox.Label>I agree to the terms and conditions</Checkbox.Label>
      <Checkbox.Control>
        <Checkbox.Indicator>
          <CheckIcon />
        </Checkbox.Indicator>
      </Checkbox.Control>
      <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
    </Checkbox.Root>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
)
```

### Root Provider

Use the `useCheckbox` hook to create the checkbox store and pass it to the `Checkbox.RootProvider` component. This
allows you to have maximum control over the checkbox programmatically.

```tsx
import { Checkbox, useCheckbox } from '@ark-ui/solid/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const checkbox = useCheckbox()

  return (
    <>
      <span>{checkbox().checked ? 'Checked' : 'UnChecked'}</span>

      <Checkbox.RootProvider value={checkbox}>
        <Checkbox.Label>Checkbox</Checkbox.Label>
        <Checkbox.Control>
          <Checkbox.Indicator>
            <CheckIcon />
          </Checkbox.Indicator>
        </Checkbox.Control>
        <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
      </Checkbox.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

> If you're using the `Checkbox.RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Checkbox.Root` component.

### Group

Use the `Checkbox.Group` component to manage a group of checkboxes. The `Checkbox.Group` component manages the state of
the checkboxes and provides a way to access the checked values.

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/solid/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

const items = [
  { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
  { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
  { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
]

export const Group = () => (
  <Checkbox.Group defaultValue={['react']} name="framework" onValueChange={console.log}>
    <For each={items}>
      {(item) => (
        <Checkbox.Root value={item.value}>
          <Checkbox.Label>{item.label}</Checkbox.Label>
          <Checkbox.Control>
            <Checkbox.Indicator>
              <CheckIcon />
            </Checkbox.Indicator>
          </Checkbox.Control>
          <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
        </Checkbox.Root>
      )}
    </For>
  </Checkbox.Group>
)
```

### Group Controlled

Use the `value` and `onValueChange` props to programmatically control the checkbox group's state. This example
demonstrates how to manage selected checkboxes in an array and display the current selection.

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/solid/checkbox'
import { Check } from 'lucide-solid'
import { createSignal, For } from 'solid-js'

const items = [
  { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
  { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
  { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
]

export const GroupControlled = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = createSignal(['react'])

  const toggleValue = () => {
    setValue((prev) => (prev[0] === 'react' ? ['solid'] : ['react']))
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={toggleValue}>Toggle Value</button>
      <Checkbox.Group value={value} onValueChange={setValue} name="framework">
        <For each={items}>
          {(item) => (
            <Checkbox.Root value={item.value}>
              <Checkbox.Label>{item.label}</Checkbox.Label>
              <Checkbox.Control>
                <Checkbox.Indicator>
                  <Check />
                </Checkbox.Indicator>
              </Checkbox.Control>
              <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
            </Checkbox.Root>
          )}
        </For>
      </Checkbox.Group>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Group Provider

Use the `useCheckboxGroup` hook to create the checkbox group store and pass it to the `Checkbox.GroupProvider`
component. This provides maximum control over the group programmatically, similar to how `RootProvider` works for
individual checkboxes.

```tsx
import { Checkbox, useCheckboxGroup } from '@ark-ui/solid/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

const items = [
  { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
  { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
  { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
  { label: 'Svelte', value: 'svelte' },
]

export const GroupProvider = () => {
  const group = useCheckboxGroup({
    defaultValue: ['react'],
    name: 'framework',
  })

  return (
    <Checkbox.GroupProvider value={group}>
      <For each={items}>
        {(item) => (
          <Checkbox.Root value={item.value}>
            <Checkbox.Label>{item.label}</Checkbox.Label>
            <Checkbox.Control>
              <Checkbox.Indicator>
                <CheckIcon />
              </Checkbox.Indicator>
            </Checkbox.Control>
            <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
          </Checkbox.Root>
        )}
      </For>
    </Checkbox.GroupProvider>
  )
}
```

### Group + Form

Use the `Checkbox.Group` component within a form to handle multiple checkbox values with form submission. The `name`
prop ensures all selected values are collected as an array when the form is submitted using `FormData.getAll()`.

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/solid/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

const items = [
  { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
  { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
  { label: 'Svelte', value: 'svelte' },
  { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
]

const handleSubmit = (event: Event) => {
  event.preventDefault()
  const formData = new FormData(event.target as HTMLFormElement)
  console.log(formData.getAll('framework'))
}

export const GroupWithForm = () => (
  <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
    <Checkbox.Group defaultValue={['react']} name="framework">
      <For each={items}>
        {(item) => (
          <Checkbox.Root value={item.value}>
            <Checkbox.Label>{item.label}</Checkbox.Label>
            <Checkbox.Control>
              <Checkbox.Indicator>
                <CheckIcon />
              </Checkbox.Indicator>
            </Checkbox.Control>
            <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
          </Checkbox.Root>
        )}
      </For>
    </Checkbox.Group>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
)
```

### Group + Invalid

Use the `invalid` prop on `Checkbox.Group` to mark the entire group as invalid for validation purposes. This applies the
invalid state to all checkboxes within the group.

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/solid/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

const items = [
  { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
  { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
  { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
  { label: 'Svelte', value: 'svelte' },
]

export const GroupWithInvalid = () => (
  <Checkbox.Group invalid>
    <For each={items}>
      {(item) => (
        <Checkbox.Root value={item.value}>
          <Checkbox.Label>{item.label}</Checkbox.Label>
          <Checkbox.Control>
            <Checkbox.Indicator>
              <CheckIcon />
            </Checkbox.Indicator>
          </Checkbox.Control>
          <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
        </Checkbox.Root>
      )}
    </For>
  </Checkbox.Group>
)
```

### Group + Select All

Implement a "select all" checkbox that controls all checkboxes within a group. The parent checkbox automatically shows
an indeterminate state when some (but not all) items are selected, and becomes fully checked when all items are
selected.

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/solid/checkbox'
import { CheckIcon, MinusIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { For, createSignal, createMemo } from 'solid-js'

const items = [
  { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
  { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
  { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
  { label: 'Svelte', value: 'svelte' },
]

export const GroupWithSelectAll = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = createSignal<string[]>([])

  const handleSelectAll = (checked: boolean) => {
    setValue(checked ? items.map((item) => item.value) : [])
  }

  const allSelected = createMemo(() => value().length === items.length)
  const indeterminate = createMemo(() => value().length > 0 && value().length < items.length)

  return (
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', 'flex-direction': 'column', gap: '10px' }}>
      <Checkbox.Root
        checked={indeterminate() ? 'indeterminate' : allSelected()}
        onCheckedChange={(details) => handleSelectAll(!!details.checked)}
      >
        <Checkbox.Label>Select All</Checkbox.Label>
        <Checkbox.Control>
          <Checkbox.Indicator>
            <CheckIcon />
          </Checkbox.Indicator>
          <Checkbox.Indicator indeterminate>
            <MinusIcon />
          </Checkbox.Indicator>
        </Checkbox.Control>
        <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
      </Checkbox.Root>

      <Checkbox.Group value={value} onValueChange={setValue} name="framework">
        <For each={items}>
          {(item) => (
            <Checkbox.Root value={item.value}>
              <Checkbox.Label>{item.label}</Checkbox.Label>
              <Checkbox.Control>
                <Checkbox.Indicator>
                  <CheckIcon />
                </Checkbox.Indicator>
                <Checkbox.Indicator indeterminate>
                  <MinusIcon />
                </Checkbox.Indicator>
              </Checkbox.Control>
              <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
            </Checkbox.Root>
          )}
        </For>
      </Checkbox.Group>

      <pre>Selected: {JSON.stringify(value())}</pre>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Group + Fieldset

Use the `Fieldset` component with `Checkbox.Group` to provide semantic grouping with legend, helper text, and error text
support.

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/solid/checkbox'
import { Fieldset } from '@ark-ui/solid/fieldset'
import { CheckIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

const items = [
  { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
  { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
  { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
  { label: 'Svelte', value: 'svelte' },
]

export const GroupWithFieldset = () => (

# Clipboard



## Anatomy

To set up the Clipboard correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



## Examples

Learn how to use the `Clipboard` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

```tsx
import { Clipboard } from '@ark-ui/solid/clipboard'
import { CheckIcon, ClipboardCopyIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

export const Basic = () => {
  return (
    <Clipboard.Root value="https://ark-ui.com">
      <Clipboard.Label>Copy this link</Clipboard.Label>
      <Clipboard.Control>
        <Clipboard.Input />
        <Clipboard.Trigger>
          <Clipboard.Indicator copied={<CheckIcon />}>
            <ClipboardCopyIcon />
          </Clipboard.Indicator>
        </Clipboard.Trigger>
      </Clipboard.Control>
    </Clipboard.Root>
  )
}
```

### Using Context

Access the clipboard state and methods using `Clipboard.Context`. This provides access to properties like `copied`,
`value`, and `setValue`

> Alternatively, you can use the `useClipboardContext` hook to access the clipboard context.

```tsx
import { Clipboard } from '@ark-ui/solid/clipboard'
import { CheckIcon, ClipboardCopyIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Show } from 'solid-js'

export const Context = () => {
  return (
    <Clipboard.Root value="https://ark-ui.com">
      <Clipboard.Label>Copy this link</Clipboard.Label>
      <Clipboard.Control>
        <Clipboard.Trigger>
          <Clipboard.Context>
            {(clipboard) => (
              <div>
                <Show when={clipboard().copied} fallback={<ClipboardCopyIcon />}>
                  <CheckIcon />
                </Show>
                <span>
                  <Show when={clipboard().copied} fallback="Copy">
                    Copied!
                  </Show>
                </span>
                <small>Value: {clipboard().value}</small>
              </div>
            )}
          </Clipboard.Context>
        </Clipboard.Trigger>
      </Clipboard.Control>
    </Clipboard.Root>
  )
}
```

### Copy Status

Use the `onStatusChange` prop to listen for copy operations. It exposes a `copied` property that you can use to display
a success message.

```tsx
import { Clipboard } from '@ark-ui/solid/clipboard'
import { CheckIcon, ClipboardCopyIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Show, createSignal } from 'solid-js'

export const CopyStatus = () => {
  const [copyCount, setCopyCount] = createSignal(0)

  return (
    <Clipboard.Root
      value="https://ark-ui.com"
      onStatusChange={(details) => {
        if (details.copied) {
          setCopyCount((prev) => prev + 1)
        }
      }}
    >
      <Clipboard.Trigger>
        <Clipboard.Indicator>
          <Show when={false} fallback={<ClipboardCopyIcon />}>
            <CheckIcon />
          </Show>
        </Clipboard.Indicator>
        Copy
      </Clipboard.Trigger>
      <p>Copied {copyCount()} times</p>
    </Clipboard.Root>
  )
}
```

### Controlled

Control the clipboard value externally by managing the state yourself and using `onValueChange` to handle updates.

```tsx
import { Clipboard } from '@ark-ui/solid/clipboard'
import { CheckIcon, ClipboardCopyIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Show, createSignal } from 'solid-js'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [url, setUrl] = createSignal('https://ark-ui.com')

  const handleUrlChange = () => {
    setUrl('https://chakra-ui.com')
  }

  return (
    <Clipboard.Root value={url()} onValueChange={({ value }) => setUrl(value)}>
      <Clipboard.Label>Copy this link</Clipboard.Label>
      <Clipboard.Control>
        <Clipboard.Input />
        <Clipboard.Trigger>
          <Clipboard.Indicator>
            <Show when={false} fallback={<ClipboardCopyIcon />}>
              <CheckIcon />
            </Show>
          </Clipboard.Indicator>
        </Clipboard.Trigger>
      </Clipboard.Control>

      <button onClick={handleUrlChange}>Change Url</button>
    </Clipboard.Root>
  )
}
```

### Root Provider

Use the `useClipboard` hook to create the clipboard store and pass it to the `Clipboard.RootProvider` component. This
allows you to have maximum control over the clipboard programmatically.

> If you're using the `Clipboard.RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Clipboard.Root` component.

```tsx
import { Clipboard, useClipboard } from '@ark-ui/solid/clipboard'
import { CheckIcon, ClipboardCopyIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const clipboard = useClipboard({ value: 'https://ark-ui.com' })

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => clipboard().copy()}>Copy</button>

      <Clipboard.RootProvider value={clipboard}>
        <Clipboard.Label>Copy this link</Clipboard.Label>
        <Clipboard.Control>
          <Clipboard.Input />
          <Clipboard.Trigger>
            <Clipboard.Indicator copied={<CheckIcon />}>
              <ClipboardCopyIcon />
            </Clipboard.Indicator>
          </Clipboard.Trigger>
        </Clipboard.Control>
      </Clipboard.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Custom Timeout

Configure the copy status timeout duration using the `timeout` prop. Default is 3000ms (3 seconds).

```tsx
import { Clipboard } from '@ark-ui/solid/clipboard'
import { CheckIcon, ClipboardCopyIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Show } from 'solid-js'

export const CustomTimeout = () => {
  return (
    <Clipboard.Root value="https://ark-ui.com" timeout={5000}>
      <Clipboard.Label>Copy this link (5 second timeout)</Clipboard.Label>
      <Clipboard.Control>
        <Clipboard.Input />
        <Clipboard.Trigger>
          <Clipboard.Indicator>
            <Show when={false} fallback={<ClipboardCopyIcon />}>
              <CheckIcon />
            </Show>
          </Clipboard.Indicator>
        </Clipboard.Trigger>
      </Clipboard.Control>
    </Clipboard.Root>
  )
}
```

### Programmatic Copy

Trigger copy operations programmatically using the context's `copy()` method.

```tsx
import { Clipboard } from '@ark-ui/solid/clipboard'

export const Programmatic = () => {
  return (
    <Clipboard.Root value="https://ark-ui.com">
      <Clipboard.Context>
        {(clipboard) => (
          <button onClick={() => clipboard().copy()}>{clipboard().copied ? 'Copied!' : 'Copy URL'}</button>
        )}
      </Clipboard.Context>
    </Clipboard.Root>
  )
}
```

### Value Text

Use `Clipboard.ValueText` to display the current clipboard value.

```tsx
import { Clipboard } from '@ark-ui/solid/clipboard'
import { CheckIcon, ClipboardCopyIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Show } from 'solid-js'

export const ValueText = () => {
  return (
    <Clipboard.Root value="https://ark-ui.com">
      <Clipboard.ValueText />
      <Clipboard.Trigger>
        <Clipboard.Indicator>
          <Show when={false} fallback={<ClipboardCopyIcon />}>
            <CheckIcon />
          </Show>
        </Clipboard.Indicator>
        Copy
      </Clipboard.Trigger>
    </Clipboard.Root>
  )
}
```

# Collapsible



## Animation

You can use CSS animations to create smooth transitions for opening and closing the Collapsible content. Utilize the
`data-state` attribute in combination with the `--height` CSS variable to animate the open and closed states.

```css
@keyframes slideDown {
  from {
    height: 0;
  }
  to {
    height: var(--height);
  }
}

@keyframes slideUp {
  from {
    height: var(--height);
  }
  to {
    height: 0;
  }
}

[data-scope='collapsible'][data-part='content'][data-state='open'] {
  animation: slideDown 250ms;
}

[data-scope='collapsible'][data-part='content'][data-state='closed'] {
  animation: slideUp 200ms;
}
```

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Collapsible` component in your project. Let's examine the most basic example

```tsx
import { Collapsible } from '@ark-ui/solid/collapsible'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

export const Basic = () => (
  <Collapsible.Root>
    <Collapsible.Trigger>
      Toggle
      <Collapsible.Indicator>
        <ChevronRightIcon />
      </Collapsible.Indicator>
    </Collapsible.Trigger>
    <Collapsible.Content>Content</Collapsible.Content>
  </Collapsible.Root>
)
```

### Disabled

Use the `disabled` prop to disable the collapsible and prevent it from being toggled.

```tsx
import { Collapsible } from '@ark-ui/solid/collapsible'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

export const Disabled = () => (
  <Collapsible.Root disabled>
    <Collapsible.Trigger>
      Toggle
      <Collapsible.Indicator>
        <ChevronRightIcon />
      </Collapsible.Indicator>
    </Collapsible.Trigger>
    <Collapsible.Content>Content</Collapsible.Content>
  </Collapsible.Root>
)
```

### Partial Collapse

Use the `collapsedHeight` or `collapsedWidth` props to create a "show more/less" pattern. When set, the content
maintains the specified dimensions when collapsed instead of collapsing to 0px.

We expose the `--collapsed-height` or `--collapsed-width` variables to use in your CSS animations.

```tsx
import { Collapsible } from '@ark-ui/solid/collapsible'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

export const PartialCollapse = () => (
  <Collapsible.Root collapsedHeight="100px">
    <Collapsible.Trigger>
      Show More
      <Collapsible.Indicator>
        <ChevronRightIcon />
      </Collapsible.Indicator>
    </Collapsible.Trigger>
    <Collapsible.Content>
      <p>
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore
        magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo
        consequat.
      </p>
      <p>

        sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
      </p>
      <p>

        aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo.
      </p>
    </Collapsible.Content>
  </Collapsible.Root>
)
```

> Interactive elements (links, buttons, inputs) within the collapsed area automatically become `inert` to prevent
> keyboard navigation to hidden content.

### Nested Collapsibles

You can nest collapsibles within collapsibles to create hierarchical content structures.

```tsx
import { Collapsible } from '@ark-ui/solid/collapsible'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

export const NestedCollapsible = () => (
  <Collapsible.Root>
    <Collapsible.Trigger>
      Getting Started
      <Collapsible.Indicator>
        <ChevronRightIcon />
      </Collapsible.Indicator>
    </Collapsible.Trigger>
    <Collapsible.Content>
      <p>Welcome to the documentation. Here are some topics to explore:</p>

      <Collapsible.Root>
        <Collapsible.Trigger>
          Installation
          <Collapsible.Indicator>
            <ChevronRightIcon />
          </Collapsible.Indicator>
        </Collapsible.Trigger>
        <Collapsible.Content>
          <p>To install the package, run one of the following commands:</p>
          <p>npm install @ark-ui/solid</p>
        </Collapsible.Content>
      </Collapsible.Root>

      <Collapsible.Root>
        <Collapsible.Trigger>
          Configuration
          <Collapsible.Indicator>
            <ChevronRightIcon />
          </Collapsible.Indicator>
        </Collapsible.Trigger>
        <Collapsible.Content>
          <p>Configure your project settings to use Ark UI components.</p>
        </Collapsible.Content>
      </Collapsible.Root>
    </Collapsible.Content>
  </Collapsible.Root>
)
```

### Events

Use `onExitComplete` callback to listen for when the `Collapsible.Content` is no longer visible

```tsx
import { Collapsible } from '@ark-ui/solid/collapsible'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

export const OnExitComplete = () => (
  <Collapsible.Root onExitComplete={() => alert('on exit')}>
    <Collapsible.Trigger>
      Toggle
      <Collapsible.Indicator>
        <ChevronRightIcon />
      </Collapsible.Indicator>
    </Collapsible.Trigger>
    <Collapsible.Content>Content</Collapsible.Content>
  </Collapsible.Root>
)
```

### Lazy Mount

To delay the mounting of the `Collapsible.Content`, use the `lazyMount` prop

```tsx
import { Collapsible } from '@ark-ui/solid/collapsible'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

export const LazyMount = () => (
  <Collapsible.Root lazyMount>
    <Collapsible.Trigger>
      Toggle
      <Collapsible.Indicator>
        <ChevronRightIcon />
      </Collapsible.Indicator>
    </Collapsible.Trigger>
    <Collapsible.Content>Content</Collapsible.Content>
  </Collapsible.Root>
)
```

### Unmount on Exit

To remove the `Collapsible.Content` from the DOM when it is not visible, use the `unmountOnExit` prop

```tsx
import { Collapsible } from '@ark-ui/solid/collapsible'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

export const UnmountOnExit = () => (
  <Collapsible.Root unmountOnExit>
    <Collapsible.Trigger>
      Toggle
      <Collapsible.Indicator>
        <ChevronRightIcon />
      </Collapsible.Indicator>
    </Collapsible.Trigger>
    <Collapsible.Content>Content</Collapsible.Content>
  </Collapsible.Root>
)
```

### Lazy Mount + Unmount on Exit

Both `lazyMount` and `unmountOnExit` can be combined to ensure that the component is mounted only when the `Collapsible`
is expanded and unmounted when it is collapsed:

```tsx
import { Collapsible } from '@ark-ui/solid/collapsible'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

export const LazyMountAndUnmountOnExit = () => (
  <Collapsible.Root lazyMount unmountOnExit>
    <Collapsible.Trigger>
      Toggle
      <Collapsible.Indicator>
        <ChevronRightIcon />
      </Collapsible.Indicator>
    </Collapsible.Trigger>
    <Collapsible.Content>Content</Collapsible.Content>
  </Collapsible.Root>
)
```

### Root Provider

Use the `useCollapsible` hook to create the collapsible store and pass it to the `Collapsible.RootProvider` component.
This allows you to have maximum control over the collapsible programmatically.

```tsx
import { Collapsible, useCollapsible } from '@ark-ui/solid/collapsible'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const collapsible = useCollapsible()

  return (
    <>
      <span>{collapsible().visible ? 'Visible' : 'Hidden'}</span>

      <Collapsible.RootProvider value={collapsible}>
        <Collapsible.Trigger>
          Toggle
          <Collapsible.Indicator>
            <ChevronRightIcon />
          </Collapsible.Indicator>
        </Collapsible.Trigger>
        <Collapsible.Content>Content</Collapsible.Content>
      </Collapsible.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

> If you're using the `Collapsible.RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Collapsible.Root` component.

### Programmatic Control

Use the `useCollapsible` hook with `Collapsible.RootProvider` to programmatically control the collapsible using the
`setOpen()` method and read state properties like `open` and `visible`.

```tsx
import { Collapsible, useCollapsible } from '@ark-ui/solid/collapsible'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

export const ProgrammaticOpen = () => {
  const collapsible = useCollapsible()

  return (
    <>
      <div>
        <p>
          Open: <strong>{String(collapsible().open)}</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Visible: <strong>{String(collapsible().visible)}</strong>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '8px', 'margin-top': '8px' }}>
        <button type="button" onClick={() => collapsible().setOpen(true)}>
          Open
        </button>
        <button type="button" onClick={() => collapsible().setOpen(false)}>
          Close
        </button>
      </div>

      <Collapsible.RootProvider value={collapsible}>
        <Collapsible.Trigger>
          Toggle
          <Collapsible.Indicator>
            <ChevronRightIcon />
          </Collapsible.Indicator>
        </Collapsible.Trigger>
        <Collapsible.Content>Content</Collapsible.Content>
      </Collapsible.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

## Guides

### Animating the Indicator

To rotate the indicator icon (such as a chevron) when the collapsible opens and closes, use CSS transforms with the
`data-state` attribute:

```css
[data-scope='collapsible'][data-part='indicator'] {
  transition: transform 200ms;

  &[data-state='open'] {
    transform: rotate(180deg);
  }
}
```

### `open` vs `visible`

When using `useCollapsible` or `useCollapsibleContext`, you can access the `open` and `visible` state properties. They
seem similar but serve different purposes:

- **`open`**: Indicates the intended state of the collapsible. This is `true` when the collapsible should be expanded
  and `false` when it should be collapsed. This changes immediately when triggered.

- **`visible`**: Indicates whether the content is currently visible in the DOM. This accounts for exit animations - the
  content remains `visible` while the closing animation plays, even though `open` is already `false`. Once the animation
  completes, `visible` becomes `false`.

### Animating the Content

Use the `--height` and/or `--width` CSS variables to animate the size of the content when it expands or closes.

If you use `collapsedHeight` or `collapsedWidth`, update your CSS animations to use the `--collapsed-height` or
`--collapsed-width` variables as the starting/ending point:

```css
@keyframes expand {
  from {
    height: var(--collapsed-height, 0);
  }
  to {
    height: var(--height);
  }
}

@keyframes collapse {
  from {
    height: var(--height);
  }
  to {
    height: var(--collapsed-height, 0);
  }
}

[data-scope='collapsible'][data-part='content'] {
  &[data-state='open'] {
    animation: expand 250ms;
  }
  &[data-state='closed'] {
    animation: collapse 250ms;
  }
}
```

# Color Picker



## Anatomy

To set up the color picker correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



## Examples

Learn how to use the `ColorPicker` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example

```tsx
import { ColorPicker, parseColor } from '@ark-ui/solid/color-picker'

export const Basic = () => {
  return (
    <ColorPicker.Root defaultValue={parseColor('#eb5e41')}>
      <ColorPicker.Label>Color</ColorPicker.Label>
      <ColorPicker.Control>
        <ColorPicker.ChannelInput channel="hex" />
        <ColorPicker.ChannelInput channel="alpha" />
        <ColorPicker.ValueText />
        <ColorPicker.Trigger>
          <ColorPicker.TransparencyGrid />
          <ColorPicker.ValueSwatch />
        </ColorPicker.Trigger>
      </ColorPicker.Control>
      <ColorPicker.Positioner>
        <ColorPicker.Content>
          <ColorPicker.FormatTrigger>Toggle ColorFormat</ColorPicker.FormatTrigger>
          <ColorPicker.FormatSelect />
          <ColorPicker.Area>
            <ColorPicker.AreaBackground />
            <ColorPicker.AreaThumb />
          </ColorPicker.Area>
          <ColorPicker.ChannelSlider channel="hue">
            <ColorPicker.ChannelSliderTrack />
            <ColorPicker.ChannelSliderThumb />
          </ColorPicker.ChannelSlider>
          <ColorPicker.ChannelSlider channel="alpha">
            <ColorPicker.TransparencyGrid />
            <ColorPicker.ChannelSliderTrack />
            <ColorPicker.ChannelSliderThumb />
          </ColorPicker.ChannelSlider>
          <ColorPicker.SwatchGroup>
            <ColorPicker.SwatchTrigger value="red">
              <ColorPicker.Swatch value="red">
                <ColorPicker.SwatchIndicator>✓</ColorPicker.SwatchIndicator>
              </ColorPicker.Swatch>
            </ColorPicker.SwatchTrigger>
            <ColorPicker.SwatchTrigger value="blue">
              <ColorPicker.Swatch value="blue">
                <ColorPicker.SwatchIndicator>✓</ColorPicker.SwatchIndicator>
              </ColorPicker.Swatch>
            </ColorPicker.SwatchTrigger>
            <ColorPicker.SwatchTrigger value="green">
              <ColorPicker.Swatch value="green">
                <ColorPicker.SwatchIndicator>✓</ColorPicker.SwatchIndicator>
              </ColorPicker.Swatch>
            </ColorPicker.SwatchTrigger>
          </ColorPicker.SwatchGroup>
          <ColorPicker.View format="rgba">
            <ColorPicker.ChannelInput channel="hex" />
            <ColorPicker.ChannelInput channel="alpha" />
          </ColorPicker.View>
          <ColorPicker.View format="hsla">
            <ColorPicker.ChannelInput channel="hue" />
            <ColorPicker.ChannelInput channel="saturation" />
            <ColorPicker.ChannelInput channel="lightness" />
          </ColorPicker.View>
          <ColorPicker.EyeDropperTrigger>Pick color</ColorPicker.EyeDropperTrigger>
        </ColorPicker.Content>
      </ColorPicker.Positioner>
      <ColorPicker.HiddenInput />
    </ColorPicker.Root>
  )
}
```

### Controlled

Use the `value` and `onValueChange` props to programatically control the color picker's state.

```tsx
import { ColorPicker, parseColor } from '@ark-ui/solid/color-picker'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [color, setColor] = createSignal(parseColor('hsl(0, 100%, 50%)'))

  return (
    <ColorPicker.Root
      value={color()}
      onValueChange={(e) => setColor(e.value)}
      onValueChangeEnd={(e) => console.log(e.valueAsString)}
    >
      <ColorPicker.Label>Color</ColorPicker.Label>
      <ColorPicker.Control>
        <ColorPicker.ChannelInput channel="hex" />
        <ColorPicker.ChannelInput channel="alpha" />
        <ColorPicker.ValueText />
        <ColorPicker.Trigger>
          <ColorPicker.TransparencyGrid />
          <ColorPicker.ValueSwatch />
        </ColorPicker.Trigger>
      </ColorPicker.Control>
      <ColorPicker.Positioner>
        <ColorPicker.Content>
          <ColorPicker.Area>
            <ColorPicker.AreaBackground />
            <ColorPicker.AreaThumb />
          </ColorPicker.Area>
          <ColorPicker.ChannelSlider channel="hue">
            <ColorPicker.ChannelSliderTrack />
            <ColorPicker.ChannelSliderThumb />
          </ColorPicker.ChannelSlider>
          <ColorPicker.ChannelSlider channel="alpha">
            <ColorPicker.TransparencyGrid />
            <ColorPicker.ChannelSliderTrack />
            <ColorPicker.ChannelSliderThumb />
          </ColorPicker.ChannelSlider>
          <ColorPicker.SwatchGroup>
            <ColorPicker.SwatchTrigger value="red">
              <ColorPicker.Swatch value="red">
                <ColorPicker.SwatchIndicator>✓</ColorPicker.SwatchIndicator>
              </ColorPicker.Swatch>
            </ColorPicker.SwatchTrigger>
            <ColorPicker.SwatchTrigger value="blue">
              <ColorPicker.Swatch value="blue">
                <ColorPicker.SwatchIndicator>✓</ColorPicker.SwatchIndicator>
              </ColorPicker.Swatch>
            </ColorPicker.SwatchTrigger>
            <ColorPicker.SwatchTrigger value="green">
              <ColorPicker.Swatch value="green">
                <ColorPicker.SwatchIndicator>✓</ColorPicker.SwatchIndicator>
              </ColorPicker.Swatch>
            </ColorPicker.SwatchTrigger>
          </ColorPicker.SwatchGroup>
          <ColorPicker.View format="rgba">
            <ColorPicker.ChannelInput channel="hex" />
            <ColorPicker.ChannelInput channel="alpha" />
          </ColorPicker.View>
          <ColorPicker.View format="hsla">
            <ColorPicker.ChannelInput channel="hue" />
            <ColorPicker.ChannelInput channel="saturation" />
            <ColorPicker.ChannelInput channel="lightness" />
          </ColorPicker.View>
          <ColorPicker.EyeDropperTrigger>Pick color</ColorPicker.EyeDropperTrigger>
        </ColorPicker.Content>
      </ColorPicker.Positioner>
      <ColorPicker.HiddenInput />
    </ColorPicker.Root>
  )
}
```

> Alternatively, the `onValueChangeEnd` prop can be used to listen for when the user has finished selecting a color.

### Field

The `Field` component helps manage form-related state and accessibility attributes of a color picker. It includes
handling ARIA labels, helper text, and error text to ensure proper accessibility.

```tsx
import { ColorPicker, parseColor } from '@ark-ui/solid/color-picker'
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'

export const WithField = (props: Field.RootProps) => (
  <Field.Root {...props}>
    <ColorPicker.Root defaultValue={parseColor('#eb5e41')}>
      <ColorPicker.Label>Label</ColorPicker.Label>
      <ColorPicker.Control>
        <ColorPicker.ChannelInput channel="hex" />
        <ColorPicker.ChannelInput channel="alpha" />
        <ColorPicker.ValueText />
        <ColorPicker.Trigger>
          <ColorPicker.TransparencyGrid />
          <ColorPicker.ValueSwatch />
        </ColorPicker.Trigger>
      </ColorPicker.Control>
      <ColorPicker.Positioner>
        <ColorPicker.Content />
      </ColorPicker.Positioner>
      <ColorPicker.HiddenInput />
    </ColorPicker.Root>
    <Field.HelperText>Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
)
```

### Root Provider

Use the `useColorPicker` hook to create the color picker store and pass it to the `ColorPicker.RootProvider` component.
This allows you to have maximum control over the color picker programmatically.

```tsx
import { ColorPicker, parseColor, useColorPicker } from '@ark-ui/solid/color-picker'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const colorPicker = useColorPicker({ defaultValue: parseColor('#eb5e41') })

  return (
    <>
      <span>Color: {colorPicker().valueAsString}</span>

      <ColorPicker.RootProvider value={colorPicker}>
        <ColorPicker.Label>Color</ColorPicker.Label>
        <ColorPicker.Control>
          <ColorPicker.ChannelInput channel="hex" />
          <ColorPicker.ChannelInput channel="alpha" />
          <ColorPicker.ValueText />
          <ColorPicker.Trigger>
            <ColorPicker.TransparencyGrid />
            <ColorPicker.ValueSwatch />
          </ColorPicker.Trigger>
        </ColorPicker.Control>
        <ColorPicker.Positioner>
          <ColorPicker.Content>
            <ColorPicker.FormatTrigger>Toggle ColorFormat</ColorPicker.FormatTrigger>
            <ColorPicker.FormatSelect />
            <ColorPicker.Area>
              <ColorPicker.AreaBackground />
              <ColorPicker.AreaThumb />
            </ColorPicker.Area>
            <ColorPicker.ChannelSlider channel="hue">
              <ColorPicker.ChannelSliderTrack />
              <ColorPicker.ChannelSliderThumb />
            </ColorPicker.ChannelSlider>
            <ColorPicker.ChannelSlider channel="alpha">
              <ColorPicker.TransparencyGrid />
              <ColorPicker.ChannelSliderTrack />
              <ColorPicker.ChannelSliderThumb />
            </ColorPicker.ChannelSlider>
            <ColorPicker.SwatchGroup>
              <ColorPicker.SwatchTrigger value="red">
                <ColorPicker.Swatch value="red">
                  <ColorPicker.SwatchIndicator>✓</ColorPicker.SwatchIndicator>
                </ColorPicker.Swatch>
              </ColorPicker.SwatchTrigger>
              <ColorPicker.SwatchTrigger value="blue">
                <ColorPicker.Swatch value="blue">
                  <ColorPicker.SwatchIndicator>✓</ColorPicker.SwatchIndicator>
                </ColorPicker.Swatch>
              </ColorPicker.SwatchTrigger>
              <ColorPicker.SwatchTrigger value="green">
                <ColorPicker.Swatch value="green">
                  <ColorPicker.SwatchIndicator>✓</ColorPicker.SwatchIndicator>

            </ColorPicker.View>
            <ColorPicker.View format="hsla">
              <ColorPicker.ChannelInput channel="hue" />
              <ColorPicker.ChannelInput channel="saturation" />
              <ColorPicker.ChannelInput channel="lightness" />
            </ColorPicker.View>
            <ColorPicker.EyeDropperTrigger>Pick color</ColorPicker.EyeDropperTrigger>
          </ColorPicker.Content>
        </ColorPicker.Positioner>
        <ColorPicker.HiddenInput />
      </ColorPicker.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

> If you're using the `ColorPicker.RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `ColorPicker.Root` component.

# Combobox



## Anatomy

To set up the combobox correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



## Examples

Learn how to use the `Combobox` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example

```tsx
import { Combobox, useListCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/combobox'
import { useFilter } from '@ark-ui/solid/locale'
import { For } from 'solid-js'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

const initialItems = ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte']

export const Basic = () => {
  const filterFn = useFilter({ sensitivity: 'base' })

  const { collection, filter } = useListCollection({
    initialItems,
    filter: filterFn().contains,
  })

  const handleInputChange = (details: Combobox.InputValueChangeDetails) => {
    filter(details.inputValue)
  }

  return (
    <Combobox.Root collection={collection()} onInputValueChange={handleInputChange}>
      <Combobox.Label>Framework</Combobox.Label>
      <Combobox.Control>
        <Combobox.Input />
        <Combobox.Trigger>Open</Combobox.Trigger>
        <Combobox.ClearTrigger>Clear</Combobox.ClearTrigger>
      </Combobox.Control>
      <Portal>
        <Combobox.Positioner>
          <Combobox.Content>
            <Combobox.ItemGroup>
              <Combobox.ItemGroupLabel>Frameworks</Combobox.ItemGroupLabel>
              <For each={collection().items}>
                {(item) => (
                  <Combobox.Item item={item}>
                    <Combobox.ItemText>{item}</Combobox.ItemText>
                    <Combobox.ItemIndicator>✓</Combobox.ItemIndicator>
                  </Combobox.Item>
                )}
              </For>
            </Combobox.ItemGroup>
          </Combobox.Content>
        </Combobox.Positioner>
      </Portal>
    </Combobox.Root>
  )
}
```

### Grouping

To group related combobox items, use the `groupBy` prop on the collection and `collection.group()` to iterate the
groups.

```tsx
import { Combobox, useListCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/combobox'
import { useFilter } from '@ark-ui/solid/locale'
import { For } from 'solid-js'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const Grouping = () => {
  const filterFn = useFilter({ sensitivity: 'base' })

  const { collection, filter } = useListCollection({
    initialItems,
    filter: filterFn().contains,
    groupBy: (item) => item.type,
  })

  const handleInputChange = (details: Combobox.InputValueChangeDetails) => {
    filter(details.inputValue)
  }
  return (
    <Combobox.Root collection={collection()} onInputValueChange={handleInputChange}>
      <Combobox.Label>Framework</Combobox.Label>
      <Combobox.Control>
        <Combobox.Input />
        <Combobox.Trigger>Open</Combobox.Trigger>
        <Combobox.ClearTrigger>Clear</Combobox.ClearTrigger>
      </Combobox.Control>
      <Portal>
        <Combobox.Positioner>
          <Combobox.Content>
            <For each={collection().group()}>
              {([type, group]) => (
                <Combobox.ItemGroup>
                  <Combobox.ItemGroupLabel>{type}</Combobox.ItemGroupLabel>
                  <For each={group}>
                    {(item) => (
                      <Combobox.Item item={item}>
                        <Combobox.ItemText>{item.label}</Combobox.ItemText>
                        <Combobox.ItemIndicator>✓</Combobox.ItemIndicator>
                      </Combobox.Item>
                    )}
                  </For>
                </Combobox.ItemGroup>
              )}
            </For>
          </Combobox.Content>
        </Combobox.Positioner>
      </Portal>
    </Combobox.Root>
  )
}

const initialItems = [
  { label: 'React', value: 'react', type: 'JS' },
  { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid', type: 'JS' },
  { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue', type: 'JS' },
  { label: 'Panda', value: 'panda', type: 'CSS' },
  { label: 'Tailwind', value: 'tailwind', type: 'CSS' },
]
```

### Field

The `Field` component helps manage form-related state and accessibility attributes of a combobox. It includes handling
ARIA labels, helper text, and error text to ensure proper accessibility.

```tsx
import { Combobox, useListCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/combobox'
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'
import { useFilter } from '@ark-ui/solid/locale'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

const initialItems = ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte']

export const WithField = (props: Field.RootProps) => {
  const filterFn = useFilter({ sensitivity: 'base' })

  const { collection, filter } = useListCollection({
    initialItems,
    filter: filterFn().contains,
  })

  const handleInputChange = (details: Combobox.InputValueChangeDetails) => {
    filter(details.inputValue)
  }

  return (
    <Field.Root {...props}>
      <Combobox.Root collection={collection()} onInputValueChange={handleInputChange}>
        <Combobox.Label>Label</Combobox.Label>
        <Combobox.Control>
          <Combobox.Input />
          <Combobox.Trigger>Open</Combobox.Trigger>
          <Combobox.ClearTrigger>Clear</Combobox.ClearTrigger>
        </Combobox.Control>
        <Combobox.Positioner>
          <Combobox.Content>
            <For each={collection().items}>
              {(item) => (
                <Combobox.Item item={item}>
                  <Combobox.ItemText>{item}</Combobox.ItemText>
                  <Combobox.ItemIndicator>✓</Combobox.ItemIndicator>
                </Combobox.Item>
              )}
            </For>
          </Combobox.Content>
        </Combobox.Positioner>
      </Combobox.Root>
      <Field.HelperText>Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
      <Field.ErrorText>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
    </Field.Root>
  )
}
```

### Root Provider

Use the `useCombobox` hook to create the combobox store and pass it to the `Combobox.RootProvider` component. This
allows you to have maximum control over the combobox programmatically.

```tsx
import { Combobox, useCombobox, useListCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/combobox'
import { useFilter } from '@ark-ui/solid/locale'
import { For } from 'solid-js'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const filterFn = useFilter({ sensitivity: 'base' })

  const { collection, filter } = useListCollection({
    initialItems: ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte'],
    filter: filterFn().contains,
  })

  const combobox = useCombobox({
    get collection() {
      return collection()
    },
    onInputValueChange(details) {
      filter(details.inputValue)
    },
  })

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => combobox().focus()}>Focus</button>

      <Combobox.RootProvider value={combobox}>
        <Combobox.Label>Framework</Combobox.Label>
        <Combobox.Control>
          <Combobox.Input />
          <Combobox.Trigger>Open</Combobox.Trigger>
          <Combobox.ClearTrigger>Clear</Combobox.ClearTrigger>
        </Combobox.Control>
        <Portal>
          <Combobox.Positioner>
            <Combobox.Content>
              <Combobox.ItemGroup>
                <Combobox.ItemGroupLabel>Frameworks</Combobox.ItemGroupLabel>
                <For each={collection().items}>
                  {(item) => (
                    <Combobox.Item item={item}>
                      <Combobox.ItemText>{item}</Combobox.ItemText>
                      <Combobox.ItemIndicator>✓</Combobox.ItemIndicator>
                    </Combobox.Item>
                  )}
                </For>
              </Combobox.ItemGroup>
            </Combobox.Content>
          </Combobox.Positioner>
        </Portal>
      </Combobox.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

> If you're using the `Combobox.RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Combobox.Root` component.

### Links

Use the `asChild` prop to render the combobox items as links.

```tsx
import { Combobox, useListCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/combobox'
import { useFilter } from '@ark-ui/solid/locale'
import { For } from 'solid-js'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const Links = () => {
  const filterFn = useFilter({ sensitivity: 'base' })

  const { collection, filter } = useListCollection({
    initialItems,
    filter: filterFn().contains,
  })

  const handleInputChange = (details: Combobox.InputValueChangeDetails) => {
    filter(details.inputValue)
  }

  return (
    <Combobox.Root collection={collection()} onInputValueChange={handleInputChange} selectionBehavior="preserve">
      <Combobox.Label>Framework</Combobox.Label>
      <Combobox.Control>
        <Combobox.Input />
      </Combobox.Control>
      <Portal>
        <Combobox.Positioner>
          <Combobox.Content>
            <For each={collection().items}>
              {(item) => (
                <Combobox.Item item={item} asChild={(props) => <a href={item.href} {...props} />}>
                  <Combobox.ItemText>{item.label}</Combobox.ItemText>
                  <Combobox.ItemIndicator>✓</Combobox.ItemIndicator>
                </Combobox.Item>
              )}
            </For>
          </Combobox.Content>
        </Combobox.Positioner>
      </Portal>
    </Combobox.Root>
  )
}

const initialItems = [
  { label: 'React', href: 'https://react.dev', value: 'react' },
  { label: 'Solid', href: 'https://solidjs.com', value: 'solid' },
  { label: 'Vue', href: 'https://vuejs.org', value: 'vue' },
  { label: 'Svelte', href: 'https://svelte.dev', value: 'svelte' },
  { label: 'Angular', href: 'https://angular.io', value: 'angular' },
  { label: 'Ember', href: 'https://emberjs.com', value: 'ember' },
  { label: 'Backbone', href: 'https://backbonejs.org', value: 'backbone' },
  { label: 'Polymer', href: 'https://polymer-project.org', value: 'polymer' },
  { label: 'Preact', href: 'https://preactjs.com', value: 'preact' },
  { label: 'Alpine', href: 'https://alpinejs.dev', value: 'alpine' },
  { label: 'Lit', href: 'https://lit.dev', value: 'lit' },
  { label: 'Qwik', href: 'https://qwik.builder.io', value: 'qwik' },
  { label: 'Astro', href: 'https://astro.build', value: 'astro' },
]
```

For custom router links, you can customize the `navigate` prop on the `Combobox.Root` component.

Here's an example of using the Tanstack Router.

```tsx
import { Combobox } from '@ark-ui/react/combobox'
import { useNavigate } from '@tanstack/react-router'

function Demo() {
  const navigate = useNavigate()
  return (
    <Combobox.Root
      navigate={(e) => {
        navigate({ to: e.node.href })
      }}
    >
      {/* ... */}
    </Combobox.Root>
  )
}
```

### Rehydrate Value

In some cases, where a combobox has a `defaultValue` or `value` but the `collection` is not loaded yet, here's how to
rehydrate the value and populate the input value.

```tsx
import { Combobox, useCombobox, useComboboxContext, useListCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/combobox'
import { For, createEffect, createRenderEffect, createSignal, on } from 'solid-js'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'
import { useAsync } from './use-async'

// The meat of the example is here.
// It rehydrates the input value when the combobox is mounted.
function ComboboxRehydrateValue() {
  const combobox = useComboboxContext()
  let hydrated = false

  createRenderEffect(() => {
    if (combobox().value.length && combobox().collection.size && !hydrated) {
      combobox().syncSelectedItems()
      hydrated = true
    }
  })

  return null
}

export const RehydrateValue = () => {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = createSignal('')

  const { collection, set } = useListCollection<Character>({
    initialItems: [],
    itemToString: (item) => item.name,
    itemToValue: (item) => item.name,
  })

  const combobox = useCombobox(() => ({
    collection: collection(),
    defaultValue: ['C-3PO'],
    placeholder: 'Example: Dexter',
    inputValue: inputValue(),
    onInputValueChange: (e) => setInputValue(e.inputValue),
  }))

  const state = useAsync(async (signal) => {
    const response = await fetch(`https://swapi.py4e.com/api/people/?search=${inputValue()}`, { signal })
    const data = await response.json()
    set(data.results)
  })

  createEffect(on(inputValue, () => state.load()))

  return (
    <Combobox.RootProvider value={combobox}>
      <Combobox.Label>Search Star Wars Characters</Combobox.Label>
      <ComboboxRehydrateValue />
      <Combobox.Control>
        <Combobox.Input placeholder="Type to search" />
      </Combobox.Control>

      <Portal>
        <Combobox.Positioner>
          <Combobox.Content>
            {state.loading() ? (
              <span>Loading...</span>
            ) : state.error() ? (
              <span>{state.error()?.message}</span>
            ) : (
              <For each={collection().items}>
                {(item) => (
                  <Combobox.Item item={item}>
                    <span>
                      {item.name} - {item.height}cm / {item.mass}kg
                    </span>
                    <Combobox.ItemIndicator />
                  </Combobox.Item>
                )}
              </For>
            )}
          </Combobox.Content>
        </Combobox.Positioner>
      </Portal>
    </Combobox.RootProvider>
  )
}

interface Character {
  name: string
  height: string
  mass: string
  created: string
  edited: string
  url: string
}
```

### Highlight Matching Text

Here's an example of highlighting the search text in combobox items based on the user's input.

```tsx
import { Combobox, useListCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/combobox'
import { Highlight } from '@ark-ui/solid/highlight'
import { useFilter } from '@ark-ui/solid/locale'
import { For } from 'solid-js'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

const initialItems = ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte']

export const WithHighlight = () => {
  const filterFn = useFilter({ sensitivity: 'base' })

  const { collection, filter } = useListCollection({
    initialItems,
    filter: filterFn().contains,
  })

  const handleInputChange = (details: Combobox.InputValueChangeDetails) => {
    filter(details.inputValue)
  }

  return (
    <Combobox.Root collection={collection()} onInputValueChange={handleInputChange}>
      <Combobox.Label>Framework</Combobox.Label>
      <Combobox.Control>
        <Combobox.Input />
        <Combobox.Trigger>Open</Combobox.Trigger>
        <Combobox.ClearTrigger>Clear</Combobox.ClearTrigger>
      </Combobox.Control>
      <Portal>
        <Combobox.Positioner>
          <Combobox.Content>
            <Combobox.ItemGroup>
              <Combobox.ItemGroupLabel>Frameworks</Combobox.ItemGroupLabel>
              <For each={collection().items}>
                {(item) => (
                  <Combobox.Item item={item}>
                    <Combobox.ItemText>
                      <Combobox.Context>
                        {(context) => <Highlight text={item} query={context().inputValue} ignoreCase />}
                      </Combobox.Context>
                    </Combobox.ItemText>
                  </Combobox.Item>
                )}
              </For>
            </Combobox.ItemGroup>
          </Combobox.Content>
        </Combobox.Positioner>
      </Portal>
    </Combobox.Root>
  )
}
```

### Dynamic Items

Generate combobox items dynamically based on user input. This is useful for creating suggestions or autocomplete
functionality.

```tsx
import { Combobox, useListCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/combobox'
import { For } from 'solid-js'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

const suggestList = ['gmail.com', 'yahoo.com', 'ark-ui.com']

export const Dynamic = () => {
  const { collection, set } = useListCollection<string>({
    initialItems: [],
  })

  const handleInputChange = (details: Combobox.InputValueChangeDetails) => {
    if (details.reason === 'input-change') {
      const items = suggestList.map((item) => `${details.inputValue}@${item}`)
      set(items)
    }
  }

  return (
    <Combobox.Root collection={collection()} onInputValueChange={handleInputChange}>
      <Combobox.Label>Framework</Combobox.Label>
      <Combobox.Control>
        <Combobox.Input />
        <Combobox.Trigger>Open</Combobox.Trigger>
      </Combobox.Control>
      <Portal>
        <Combobox.Positioner>
          <Combobox.Content>
            <For each={collection().items}>
              {(item) => (
                <Combobox.Item item={item}>
                  <Combobox.ItemText>{item}</Combobox.ItemText>
                  <Combobox.ItemIndicator>✓</Combobox.ItemIndicator>
                </Combobox.Item>
              )}
            </For>
          </Combobox.Content>
        </Combobox.Positioner>
      </Portal>
    </Combobox.Root>
  )
}
```

### Creatable Options

Allow users to create new options when their search doesn't match any existing items. This is useful for tags,
categories, or other custom values.

```tsx
import { Combobox, useListCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/combobox'
import { useFilter } from '@ark-ui/solid/locale'
import { createSignal, For } from 'solid-js'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

interface Item {
  label: string
  value: string
  __new__?: boolean
}

const NEW_OPTION_VALUE = '[[new]]'
const createNewOption = (value: string): Item => ({ label: value, value: NEW_OPTION_VALUE })
const isNewOptionValue = (value: string) => value === NEW_OPTION_VALUE
const replaceNewOptionValue = (values: string[], value: string) =>
  values.map((v) => (v === NEW_OPTION_VALUE ? value : v))
const getNewOptionData = (inputValue: string): Item => ({ label: inputValue, value: inputValue, __new__: true })

export const Creatable = () => {
  const filterFn = useFilter({ sensitivity: 'base' })

  const { collection, filter, upsert, update, remove } = useListCollection<Item>({
    initialItems: [
      { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
      { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
      { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
      { label: 'Svelte', value: 'svelte' },
    ],
    filter: filterFn().contains,
  })

  const isValidNewOption = (inputValue: string) => {
    const exactOptionMatch =
      collection().items.filter((item) => item.label.toLowerCase() === inputValue.toLowerCase()).length > 0
    return !exactOptionMatch && inputValue.trim().length > 0
  }

  const [selectedValue, setSelectedValue] = createSignal<string[]>([])
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = createSignal('')

  const handleInputChange = ({ inputValue: newInputValue, reason }: Combobox.InputValueChangeDetails) => {
    if (reason === 'input-change' || reason === 'item-select') {
      if (isValidNewOption(newInputValue)) {
        upsert(NEW_OPTION_VALUE, createNewOption(newInputValue))
      } else if (newInputValue.trim().length === 0) {
        remove(NEW_OPTION_VALUE)
      }
      filter(newInputValue)
    }
    setInputValue(newInputValue)
  }

  const handleOpenChange = ({ reason }: Combobox.OpenChangeDetails) => {
    if (reason === 'trigger-click') {
      filter('')
    }
  }

  const handleValueChange = ({ value }: Combobox.ValueChangeDetails) => {
    setSelectedValue(replaceNewOptionValue(value, inputValue()))
    if (value.includes(NEW_OPTION_VALUE)) {
      console.log('New Option Created', inputValue())
      update(NEW_OPTION_VALUE, getNewOptionData(inputValue()))
    }
  }

  return (
    <Combobox.Root
      collection={collection()}
      onInputValueChange={handleInputChange}
      onOpenChange={handleOpenChange}
      value={selectedValue()}
      onValueChange={handleValueChange}
      allowCustomValue
    >
      <Combobox.Control>
        <Combobox.Input placeholder="Search..." />
        <Combobox.Trigger>Open</Combobox.Trigger>
        <Combobox.ClearTrigger>Clear</Combobox.ClearTrigger>
      </Combobox.Control>
      <Portal>
        <Combobox.Positioner>
          <Combobox.Content>
            <Combobox.ItemGroup>
              <Combobox.ItemGroupLabel>Frameworks</Combobox.ItemGroupLabel>
              <For each={collection().items}>
                {(item) => (
                  <Combobox.Item item={item}>
                    {isNewOptionValue(item.value) ? (
                      <Combobox.ItemText>+ Create "{item.label}"</Combobox.ItemText>
                    ) : (
                      <Combobox.ItemText>
                        {item.label} {item.__new__ ? NEW_OPTION_VALUE : ''}
                      </Combobox.ItemText>
                    )}
                    <Combobox.ItemIndicator>✓</Combobox.ItemIndicator>
                  </Combobox.Item>
                )}
              </For>
            </Combobox.ItemGroup>
          </Combobox.Content>
        </Combobox.Positioner>
      </Portal>
    </Combobox.Root>
  )
}
```

### Custom Objects

By default, the combobox collection expects an array of objects with `label` and `value` properties. In some cases, you
may need to deal with custom objects.

Use the `itemToString` and `itemToValue` props to map the custom object to the required interface.

```tsx
const items = [
  { country: 'United States', code: 'US', flag: '🇺🇸' },
  { country: 'Canada', code: 'CA', flag: '🇨🇦' },
  { country: 'Australia', code: 'AU', flag: '🇦🇺' },
  // ...
]

const { collection } = useListCollection({
  initialItems: items,
  itemToString: (item) => item.country,
  itemToValue: (item) => item.code,
})
```

```tsx
import { Combobox, useListCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/combobox'
import { useFilter } from '@ark-ui/solid/locale'
import { For } from 'solid-js'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const CustomObject = () => {
  const filterFn = useFilter({ sensitivity: 'base' })

  const { collection, filter } = useListCollection({
    initialItems: [
      { country: 'United States', code: 'US', flag: '🇺🇸' },
      { country: 'Canada', code: 'CA', flag: '🇨🇦' },
      { country: 'Australia', code: 'AU', flag: '🇦🇺' },
    ],
    itemToString: (item) => item.country,
    itemToValue: (item) => item.code,
    filter: filterFn().contains,
  })

  const handleInputChange = (details: Combobox.InputValueChangeDetails) => {
    filter(details.inputValue)
  }

  return (
    <Combobox.Root collection={collection()} onInputValueChange={handleInputChange}>
      <Combobox.Control>
        <Combobox.Input />
        <Combobox.Trigger>Open</Combobox.Trigger>
        <Combobox.ClearTrigger>Clear</Combobox.ClearTrigger>
      </Combobox.Control>
      <Portal>
        <Combobox.Positioner>
          <Combobox.Content>
            <Combobox.ItemGroup>
              <Combobox.ItemGroupLabel>Countries</Combobox.ItemGroupLabel>
              <For each={collection().items}>
                {(item) => (
                  <Combobox.Item item={item}>
                    <Combobox.ItemText>{item.country}</Combobox.ItemText>
                    <Combobox.ItemIndicator>✓</Combobox.ItemIndicator>
                  </Combobox.Item>
                )}
              </For>
            </Combobox.ItemGroup>
          </Combobox.Content>
        </Combobox.Positioner>
      </Portal>
    </Combobox.Root>
  )
}
```

## Guides

### Type-Safety

The `Combobox.RootComponent` type enables you to create closed, strongly typed wrapper components that maintain full
type safety for collection items.

This is particularly useful when building reusable combobox components with custom props and consistent styling.

```tsx
import { Combobox as ArkCombobox, type CollectionItem } from '@ark-ui/react/combobox'
import { useListCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/collection'

interface ComboboxProps<T extends CollectionItem> extends ArkCombobox.RootProps<T> {}

const Combobox: ArkCombobox.RootComponent = (props) => {
  return <ArkCombobox.Root {...props}>{/* ... */}</ArkCombobox.Root>
}
```

Then, you can use the `Combobox` component as follows:

```tsx
const App = () => {
  const { collection } = useListCollection({
    initialItems: [
      { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
      { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
      { label: 'Svelte', value: 'svelte' },
    ],
  })
  return (
    <Combobox
      collection={collection}
      onValueChange={(e) => {
        // this will be strongly typed Array<{ label: string, value: string }>
        console.log(e.items)
      }}
    >
      {/* ... */}
    </Combobox>
  )
}
```

### Limit Large Datasets

The recommended way of managing large lists is to use the `limit` property on the `useListCollection` hook. This will
limit the number of rendered items in the DOM to improve performance.

```tsx {3}
const { collection } = useListCollection({
  initialItems: items,
  limit: 10,
})
```

### Available height and width

The following css variables are exposed to the `Combobox.Positioner` which you can use to style the `Combobox.Content`

```css
/* width of the combobox control */
--reference-width: <pixel-value>;
/* width of the available viewport */
--available-width: <pixel-value>;
/* height of the available viewport */
--available-height: <pixel-value>;
```

For example, if you want to make sure the maximum height doesn't exceed the available height, you can use the following:

```css
[data-scope='combobox'][data-part='content'] {
  max-height: calc(var(--available-height) - 100px);
}
```

# Date Picker



## Anatomy

To set up the date picker correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



## Examples

Learn how to use the `DatePicker` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example

```tsx
import { DatePicker } from '@ark-ui/solid/date-picker'
import { Index, Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const Basic = () => {
  return (
    <DatePicker.Root>
      <DatePicker.Label>Label</DatePicker.Label>

      <DatePicker.Control>
        <DatePicker.Input />
        <DatePicker.Trigger>📅</DatePicker.Trigger>
        <DatePicker.ClearTrigger>Clear</DatePicker.ClearTrigger>
      </DatePicker.Control>

      <Portal>
        <DatePicker.Positioner>
          <DatePicker.Content>
            <DatePicker.YearSelect />
            <DatePicker.MonthSelect />
            <DatePicker.View view="day">
              <DatePicker.Context>
                {(context) => (
                  <>

                      <DatePicker.PrevTrigger>Prev</DatePicker.PrevTrigger>
                      <DatePicker.ViewTrigger>
                        <DatePicker.RangeText />
                      </DatePicker.ViewTrigger>
                      <DatePicker.NextTrigger>Next</DatePicker.NextTrigger>
                    </DatePicker.ViewControl>

### Range Selection

To create a date picker that allows a range selection, you need to:

- Set the `selectionMode` prop to `range`.
- Render multiple inputs with the `index` prop set to `0` and `1`.

```tsx
import { DatePicker } from '@ark-ui/solid/date-picker'
import { Index, createMemo } from 'solid-js'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const Range = () => {
  return (
    <DatePicker.Root selectionMode="range">
      <DatePicker.Label>Label</DatePicker.Label>

      <DatePicker.Control>
        <DatePicker.Input index={0} />
        <DatePicker.Input index={1} />
        <DatePicker.Trigger>📅</DatePicker.Trigger>
        <DatePicker.ClearTrigger>Clear</DatePicker.ClearTrigger>
      </DatePicker.Control>

      <DatePicker.PresetTrigger value="last7Days">Last 7 days</DatePicker.PresetTrigger>

      <Portal>
        <DatePicker.Positioner>
          <DatePicker.Content>
            <DatePicker.YearSelect />
            <DatePicker.MonthSelect />

            <div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '10px' }}>
              <DatePicker.Context>
                {(context) => (
                  <DatePicker.Table>
                    <DatePicker.TableHead>
                      <DatePicker.TableRow>
                        <Index each={context().weekDays}>
                          {(weekDay) => <DatePicker.TableHeader>{weekDay().short}</DatePicker.TableHeader>}
                        </Index>
                      </DatePicker.TableRow>
                    </DatePicker.TableHead>

                    <DatePicker.TableBody>
                      <Index each={context().weeks}>
                        {(week) => (
                          <DatePicker.TableRow>
                            <Index each={week()}>
                              {(day) => (
                                <DatePicker.TableCell value={day()}>
                                  <DatePicker.TableCellTrigger>{day().day}</DatePicker.TableCellTrigger>
                                </DatePicker.TableCell>
                              )}
                            </Index>
                          </DatePicker.TableRow>
                        )}
                      </Index>
                    </DatePicker.TableBody>
                  </DatePicker.Table>
                )}
              </DatePicker.Context>

              <DatePicker.Context>
                {(context) => {
                  const offset = createMemo(() => context().getOffset({ months: 1 }))
                  return (
                    <DatePicker.Table>
                      <DatePicker.TableHead>
                        <DatePicker.TableRow>
                          <Index each={context().weekDays}>
                            {(weekDay) => <DatePicker.TableHeader>{weekDay().short}</DatePicker.TableHeader>}
                          </Index>
                        </DatePicker.TableRow>
                      </DatePicker.TableHead>

                      <DatePicker.TableBody>
                        <Index each={offset().weeks}>
                          {(week) => (
                            <DatePicker.TableRow>
                              <Index each={week()}>
                                {(day) => (
                                  <DatePicker.TableCell value={day()} visibleRange={offset().visibleRange}>
                                    <DatePicker.TableCellTrigger>{day().day}</DatePicker.TableCellTrigger>
                                  </DatePicker.TableCell>
                                )}
                              </Index>
                            </DatePicker.TableRow>
                          )}
                        </Index>
                      </DatePicker.TableBody>
                    </DatePicker.Table>
                  )
                }}
              </DatePicker.Context>
            </div>
          </DatePicker.Content>
        </DatePicker.Positioner>
      </Portal>
    </DatePicker.Root>
  )
}
```

### Multiple Months

To create a date picker that allows multiple months, you need to:

- Set the `numOfMonths` prop to the number of months you want to display.
- Use the `datePicker.getOffset({ months: 1 })` prop to offset the date picker to the next month.
- Render a `DatePicker.RangeText` component to display the range text.

```tsx
import { DatePicker } from '@ark-ui/solid/date-picker'
import { Index, createMemo } from 'solid-js'

export const MultipleMonths = () => {
  return (
    <DatePicker.Root numOfMonths={2}>
      <DatePicker.Label>Label</DatePicker.Label>

      <DatePicker.Control>
        <DatePicker.Input index={0} />
        <DatePicker.Trigger>📅</DatePicker.Trigger>
        <DatePicker.ClearTrigger>Clear</DatePicker.ClearTrigger>
      </DatePicker.Control>

      <DatePicker.Positioner>
        <DatePicker.Content>
          <DatePicker.YearSelect />
          <DatePicker.MonthSelect />
          <DatePicker.ViewControl>
            <DatePicker.PrevTrigger>Prev</DatePicker.PrevTrigger>
            <DatePicker.RangeText />
            <DatePicker.NextTrigger>Next</DatePicker.NextTrigger>
          </DatePicker.ViewControl>

          <div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '10px' }}>
            {/* First month */}
            <DatePicker.Context>
              {(datePicker) => (
                <DatePicker.Table>
                  <DatePicker.TableHead>
                    <DatePicker.TableRow>
                      <Index each={datePicker().weekDays}>
                        {(weekDay) => <DatePicker.TableHeader>{weekDay().short}</DatePicker.TableHeader>}
                      </Index>
                    </DatePicker.TableRow>
                  </DatePicker.TableHead>
                  <DatePicker.TableBody>
                    <Index each={datePicker().weeks}>
                      {(week) => (
                        <DatePicker.TableRow>
                          <Index each={week()}>
                            {(day) => (
                              <DatePicker.TableCell value={day()}>
                                <DatePicker.TableCellTrigger>{day().day}</DatePicker.TableCellTrigger>
                              </DatePicker.TableCell>
                            )}
                          </Index>
                        </DatePicker.TableRow>
                      )}
                    </Index>
                  </DatePicker.TableBody>
                </DatePicker.Table>
              )}
            </DatePicker.Context>

            {/* Second month */}
            <DatePicker.Context>
              {(datePicker) => {
                const offset = createMemo(() => datePicker().getOffset({ months: 1 }))
                return (
                  <DatePicker.Table>
                    <DatePicker.TableHead>
                      <DatePicker.TableRow>
                        <Index each={datePicker().weekDays}>
                          {(weekDay) => <DatePicker.TableHeader>{weekDay().short}</DatePicker.TableHeader>}
                        </Index>
                      </DatePicker.TableRow>
                    </DatePicker.TableHead>
                    <DatePicker.TableBody>
                      <Index each={offset().weeks}>
                        {(week) => (
                          <DatePicker.TableRow>
                            <Index each={week()}>
                              {(day) => (
                                <DatePicker.TableCell value={day()} visibleRange={offset().visibleRange}>
                                  <DatePicker.TableCellTrigger>{day().day}</DatePicker.TableCellTrigger>
                                </DatePicker.TableCell>
                              )}
                            </Index>
                          </DatePicker.TableRow>
                        )}
                      </Index>
                    </DatePicker.TableBody>
                  </DatePicker.Table>
                )
              }}
            </DatePicker.Context>
          </div>
        </DatePicker.Content>
      </DatePicker.Positioner>
    </DatePicker.Root>
  )
}
```

### Inline

In some cases, you might want to display an inline date picker without a popup. This can be achieved by passing the
`inline` prop and avoiding the use of `Portal`, `Positioner` and `Content` components.

> Important to note that inline date picker doesn't use the `Portal` and `Positioner` components.

```tsx
import { DatePicker } from '@ark-ui/solid/date-picker'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const Inline = () => {
  return (
    <DatePicker.Root open>
      <DatePicker.Context>
        {(context) => (
          <>
            <DatePicker.View view="day">
              <DatePicker.ViewControl>
                <DatePicker.PrevTrigger>Prev</DatePicker.PrevTrigger>
                <DatePicker.ViewTrigger>
                  <DatePicker.RangeText />
                </DatePicker.ViewTrigger>
                <DatePicker.NextTrigger>Next</DatePicker.NextTrigger>
              </DatePicker.ViewControl>

              <DatePicker.Table>
                <DatePicker.TableHead>
                  <DatePicker.TableRow>
                    <Index each={context().weekDays}>
                      {(weekDay) => <DatePicker.TableHeader>{weekDay().short}</DatePicker.TableHeader>}

### Root Provider

Use the `useDatePicker` hook to create the date picker store and pass it to the `DatePicker.RootProvider` component.
This allows you to have maximum control over the date picker programmatically.

```tsx
import { DatePicker, useDatePicker } from '@ark-ui/solid/date-picker'
import { Index, Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const datePicker = useDatePicker()

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => datePicker().clearValue()}>Clear</button>

      <DatePicker.RootProvider value={datePicker}>
        <DatePicker.Label>Label</DatePicker.Label>

        <DatePicker.Control>
          <DatePicker.Input />
          <DatePicker.Trigger>📅</DatePicker.Trigger>

# Dialog



## Anatomy

To use the dialog component correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



## Examples

Learn how to use the `Dialog` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example

```tsx
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Dialog } from '@ark-ui/solid/dialog'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const Basic = () => {
  return (
    <Dialog.Root defaultOpen>
      <Dialog.Trigger>Open Dialog</Dialog.Trigger>
      <Portal>
        <Dialog.Backdrop />
        <Dialog.Positioner>
          <Dialog.Content>
            <Dialog.Title>Dialog Title</Dialog.Title>
            <Dialog.Description>Dialog Description</Dialog.Description>
            <Dialog.CloseTrigger>
              <XIcon />
            </Dialog.CloseTrigger>
          </Dialog.Content>
        </Dialog.Positioner>
      </Portal>
    </Dialog.Root>
  )
}
```

### Controlled

To create a controlled Dialog component, manage the state of the dialog using the `open` and `onOpenChange` props:

```tsx
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Dialog } from '@ark-ui/solid/dialog'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [open, setOpen] = createSignal(false)

  return (
    <>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => setOpen(true)}>
        Open Dialog
      </button>
      <Dialog.Root open={open()} onOpenChange={() => setOpen(false)}>
        <Portal>
          <Dialog.Backdrop />
          <Dialog.Positioner>
            <Dialog.Content>
              <Dialog.Title>Dialog Title</Dialog.Title>
              <Dialog.Description>Dialog Description</Dialog.Description>
              <Dialog.CloseTrigger>
                <XIcon />
              </Dialog.CloseTrigger>
            </Dialog.Content>
          </Dialog.Positioner>
        </Portal>
      </Dialog.Root>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Lazy Mount

Lazy mounting is a feature that allows the content of a dialog to be rendered only when the dialog is first opened. This
is useful for performance optimization, especially when dialog content is large or complex. To enable lazy mounting, use
the `lazyMount` prop on the `Dialog.Root` component.

In addition, the `unmountOnExit` prop can be used in conjunction with `lazyMount` to unmount the dialog content when the
Dialog is closed, freeing up resources. The next time the dialog is activated, its content will be re-rendered.

```tsx
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Dialog } from '@ark-ui/solid/dialog'

export const LazyMount = () => {
  return (
    <Dialog.Root lazyMount unmountOnExit>
      <Dialog.Trigger>Open Dialog</Dialog.Trigger>
      <Dialog.Backdrop />
      <Dialog.Positioner>
        <Dialog.Content>
          <Dialog.Title>Dialog Title</Dialog.Title>
          <Dialog.Description>Dialog Description</Dialog.Description>
          <Dialog.CloseTrigger>
            <XIcon />
          </Dialog.CloseTrigger>
        </Dialog.Content>
      </Dialog.Positioner>
    </Dialog.Root>
  )
}
```

### Alert Dialog

For critical confirmations or destructive actions, use `role="alertdialog"`. Alert dialogs differ from regular dialogs
in important ways:

- **Automatic focus**: The close/cancel button receives focus when opened, prioritizing the safest action
- **Requires explicit dismissal**: Cannot be closed by clicking outside, only via button clicks or Escape key

```tsx
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Dialog } from '@ark-ui/solid/dialog'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const AlertDialog = () => {
  return (
    <Dialog.Root role="alertdialog">
      <Dialog.Trigger>Delete Account</Dialog.Trigger>
      <Portal>
        <Dialog.Backdrop />
        <Dialog.Positioner>
          <Dialog.Content>
            <Dialog.Title>Are you absolutely sure?</Dialog.Title>
            <Dialog.Description>
              This action cannot be undone. This will permanently delete your account and remove your data from our
              servers.
            </Dialog.Description>
            <div>
              <Dialog.CloseTrigger>
                <XIcon />
              </Dialog.CloseTrigger>
              <button type="button">Delete Account</button>
            </div>
          </Dialog.Content>
        </Dialog.Positioner>
      </Portal>
    </Dialog.Root>
  )
}
```

### Initial Focus

Control which element receives focus when the dialog opens using the `initialFocusEl` prop. This is useful for forms
where you want to focus a specific input field:

```tsx
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Dialog } from '@ark-ui/solid/dialog'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const InitialFocus = () => {
  let inputRef: HTMLInputElement | null = null

  return (
    <Dialog.Root initialFocusEl={() => inputRef}>
      <Dialog.Trigger>Open Dialog</Dialog.Trigger>
      <Portal>
        <Dialog.Backdrop />
        <Dialog.Positioner>
          <Dialog.Content>
            <Dialog.Title>Edit Profile</Dialog.Title>
            <Dialog.Description>
              Make changes to your profile here. The first input will be focused when the dialog opens.
            </Dialog.Description>
            <input ref={inputRef!} type="text" placeholder="Enter your name..." />
            <input type="email" placeholder="Enter your email..." />
            <Dialog.CloseTrigger>
              <XIcon />
            </Dialog.CloseTrigger>
          </Dialog.Content>
        </Dialog.Positioner>
      </Portal>
    </Dialog.Root>
  )
}
```

### Final Focus

Control which element receives focus when the dialog closes using the `finalFocusEl` prop. By default, focus returns to
the trigger element, but you can specify a different element:

```tsx
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Dialog } from '@ark-ui/solid/dialog'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const FinalFocus = () => {
  let finalRef: HTMLButtonElement | null = null

  return (
    <>
      <button type="button" ref={finalRef!}>
        I will receive focus when dialog closes
      </button>
      <Dialog.Root finalFocusEl={() => finalRef}>
        <Dialog.Trigger>Open Dialog</Dialog.Trigger>
        <Portal>
          <Dialog.Backdrop />
          <Dialog.Positioner>
            <Dialog.Content>
              <Dialog.Title>Dialog Title</Dialog.Title>
              <Dialog.Description>
                When this dialog closes, focus will return to the button above instead of the trigger.
              </Dialog.Description>
              <Dialog.CloseTrigger>
                <XIcon />
              </Dialog.CloseTrigger>
            </Dialog.Content>
          </Dialog.Positioner>
        </Portal>
      </Dialog.Root>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Non-Modal Dialog

Use `modal={false}` to create a non-modal dialog that allows interaction with elements outside of it. This disables
focus trapping, scroll prevention, and pointer blocking, making it useful for auxiliary panels or inspector windows:

```tsx
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Dialog } from '@ark-ui/solid/dialog'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const NonModal = () => {
  return (
    <Dialog.Root modal={false}>
      <Dialog.Trigger>Open Non-Modal Dialog</Dialog.Trigger>
      <Portal>
        <Dialog.Backdrop />
        <Dialog.Positioner>
          <Dialog.Content>
            <Dialog.Title>Non-Modal Dialog</Dialog.Title>
            <Dialog.Description>
              This dialog allows interaction with elements outside. You can click buttons, select text, and interact
              with the page behind it.
            </Dialog.Description>
            <Dialog.CloseTrigger>
              <XIcon />
            </Dialog.CloseTrigger>
          </Dialog.Content>
        </Dialog.Positioner>
      </Portal>
    </Dialog.Root>
  )
}
```

### Close on Interact Outside

Prevent the dialog from closing when clicking outside by setting `closeOnInteractOutside={false}`. Use the
`onInteractOutside` event with `e.preventDefault()` for advanced control:

```tsx
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Dialog } from '@ark-ui/solid/dialog'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const CloseOnInteractOutside = () => {
  return (
    <Dialog.Root
      closeOnInteractOutside={false}
      onInteractOutside={(e) => {
        const target = e.target as HTMLElement
        if (target.closest('[data-allow-close]')) {
          return
        }
        e.preventDefault()
      }}
    >
      <Dialog.Trigger>Open Dialog</Dialog.Trigger>
      <Portal>
        <Dialog.Backdrop />
        <Dialog.Positioner>
          <Dialog.Content>
            <Dialog.Title>Custom Close Behavior</Dialog.Title>
            <Dialog.Description>
              This dialog will not close when clicking outside. Try clicking the backdrop or pressing Escape to see that
              it stays open. Only the close button will dismiss it.
            </Dialog.Description>
            <Dialog.CloseTrigger>
              <XIcon />
            </Dialog.CloseTrigger>
          </Dialog.Content>
        </Dialog.Positioner>
      </Portal>
    </Dialog.Root>
  )
}
```

### Close on Escape

Prevent the dialog from closing when pressing Escape by setting `closeOnEscape={false}`. Use the `onEscapeKeyDown` event
with `e.preventDefault()` to implement custom behavior like unsaved changes warnings:

```tsx
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Dialog } from '@ark-ui/solid/dialog'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const CloseOnEscape = () => {
  return (
    <Dialog.Root
      closeOnEscape={false}
      onEscapeKeyDown={(e) => {
        const hasUnsavedChanges = true
        if (hasUnsavedChanges) {
          e.preventDefault()
          alert('You have unsaved changes. Please save or discard them before closing.')
        }
      }}
    >
      <Dialog.Trigger>Open Dialog</Dialog.Trigger>
      <Portal>
        <Dialog.Backdrop />
        <Dialog.Positioner>
          <Dialog.Content>
            <Dialog.Title>Unsaved Changes</Dialog.Title>
            <Dialog.Description>
              This dialog prevents closing with Escape key. Try pressing Escape to see the warning. Use the close button
              to dismiss.
            </Dialog.Description>
            <textarea placeholder="Type something..." rows={4} style={{ width: '100%' }} />
            <Dialog.CloseTrigger>
              <XIcon />
            </Dialog.CloseTrigger>
          </Dialog.Content>
        </Dialog.Positioner>
      </Portal>
    </Dialog.Root>
  )
}
```

### Render Function

Use the `Dialog.Context` component to access the dialog's state and methods.

```tsx
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Dialog } from '@ark-ui/solid/dialog'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const RenderFn = () => {
  return (
    <Dialog.Root>
      <Dialog.Trigger>Open Dialog</Dialog.Trigger>
      <Portal>
        <Dialog.Backdrop />
        <Dialog.Positioner>
          <Dialog.Content>
            <Dialog.Title>Dialog Title</Dialog.Title>
            <Dialog.Description>Dialog Description</Dialog.Description>
            <Dialog.CloseTrigger>
              <XIcon />
            </Dialog.CloseTrigger>
          </Dialog.Content>
        </Dialog.Positioner>
      </Portal>
      <Dialog.Context>{(context) => <p>Dialog is {context().open ? 'open' : 'closed'}</p>}</Dialog.Context>
    </Dialog.Root>
  )
}
```

### Root Provider

The `useDialog` hook gives you programmatic access to the dialog's state and methods. Use it with `Dialog.RootProvider`
when you need to control the dialog from outside its component tree.

```tsx
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Dialog, useDialog } from '@ark-ui/solid/dialog'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const dialog = useDialog()

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => dialog().setOpen(true)}>Open</button>

      <Dialog.RootProvider value={dialog}>
        <Dialog.Trigger>Open Dialog</Dialog.Trigger>
        <Portal>
          <Dialog.Backdrop />
          <Dialog.Positioner>
            <Dialog.Content>
              <Dialog.Title>Dialog Title</Dialog.Title>
              <Dialog.Description>Dialog Description</Dialog.Description>
              <Dialog.CloseTrigger>
                <XIcon />
              </Dialog.CloseTrigger>
            </Dialog.Content>
          </Dialog.Positioner>
        </Portal>
      </Dialog.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

> **Note:** There are two ways to use the Dialog component: (1) `Dialog.Root` for declarative usage, or (2)
> `useDialog()` + `Dialog.RootProvider` for programmatic control with access to state properties and methods like
> `setOpen()`. Never use both approaches together - choose one based on your needs.

### Nested Dialogs

Multiple dialogs can be stacked with automatic z-index management. Zag.js manages layering through CSS variables like
`--z-index` and `--layer-index`, which are automatically updated when dialogs are opened or closed:

```tsx
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Dialog, useDialog } from '@ark-ui/solid/dialog'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const Nested = () => {
  const parentDialog = useDialog()
  const childDialog = useDialog()

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => parentDialog().setOpen(true)}>Open Parent Dialog</button>

      <Dialog.RootProvider value={parentDialog}>
        <Portal>
          <Dialog.Backdrop />
          <Dialog.Positioner>
            <Dialog.Content>
              <Dialog.Title>Parent Dialog</Dialog.Title>
              <Dialog.Description>
                This is the parent dialog. Open a nested dialog from here to see automatic z-index management via CSS
                variables like --z-index and --layer-index.
              </Dialog.Description>
              <button onClick={() => childDialog().setOpen(true)}>Open Nested Dialog</button>
              <Dialog.CloseTrigger>
                <XIcon />
              </Dialog.CloseTrigger>
            </Dialog.Content>
          </Dialog.Positioner>
        </Portal>
      </Dialog.RootProvider>

      <Dialog.RootProvider value={childDialog}>
        <Portal>
          <Dialog.Backdrop />
          <Dialog.Positioner>
            <Dialog.Content>
              <Dialog.Title>Nested Dialog</Dialog.Title>
              <Dialog.Description>
                This dialog is nested within the parent. Notice how it layers on top with proper z-index management.
              </Dialog.Description>
              <button onClick={() => parentDialog().setOpen(false)}>Close Parent Dialog</button>
              <Dialog.CloseTrigger>
                <XIcon />
              </Dialog.CloseTrigger>
            </Dialog.Content>
          </Dialog.Positioner>
        </Portal>
      </Dialog.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

You can create a zoom-out effect for parent dialogs using the `data-has-nested` attribute and `--nested-layer-count`
variable:

```css
[data-scope='dialog'][data-part='backdrop'][data-has-nested] {
  transform: scale(calc(1 - var(--nested-layer-count) * 0.05));
}
```

### Confirmation Dialog

Dialogs can intercept close attempts to show confirmation prompts. This pattern is useful for preventing data loss from
unsaved changes:

```tsx
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Dialog, useDialog } from '@ark-ui/solid/dialog'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const Confirmation = () => {
  const [formContent, setFormContent] = createSignal('')
  const parentDialog = useDialog({
    onOpenChange: (details) => {
      if (!details.open && formContent().trim()) {
        confirmDialog().setOpen(true)
      }
    },
  })
  const confirmDialog = useDialog()

  const handleConfirmClose = () => {
    confirmDialog().setOpen(false)
    parentDialog().setOpen(false)
    setFormContent('')
  }

### Lazy Mount and Dynamic Imports

When using `lazyMount` and dynamically rendering components in the dialog (via `React.lazy`, Next.js `dynamic`), wrap
the imported component in a `Suspense` component to render a fallback.

```tsx
import { Dialog } from '@ark-ui/react/dialog'
import { Suspense } from 'react'
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const HeavyComponent = dynamic(() => import('./HeavyComponent'))

export default function DialogExample() {
  return (
    <Dialog.Root lazyMount>
      <Dialog.Trigger>Open Dialog</Dialog.Trigger>
      <Dialog.Content>
        <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
          <HeavyComponent />
        </Suspense>
      </Dialog.Content>
    </Dialog.Root>
  )
}
```

# Editable



## Anatomy

To set up the editable correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



## Examples

Learn how to use the `Editable` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

```tsx
import { Editable } from '@ark-ui/solid/editable'

export const Basic = () => (
  <Editable.Root placeholder="Placeholder">
    <Editable.Label>Label</Editable.Label>
    <Editable.Area>
      <Editable.Input />
      <Editable.Preview />
    </Editable.Area>
  </Editable.Root>
)
```

### Custom controls

In some cases, you might need to use custom controls to toggle the edit and read mode. We use the render prop pattern to
provide access to the internal state of the component.

```tsx
import { Editable } from '@ark-ui/solid/editable'
import { Show } from 'solid-js'

export const CustomControls = () => (
  <Editable.Root placeholder="enter a value" defaultValue="Chakra">
    <Editable.Label>Label</Editable.Label>
    <Editable.Area>
      <Editable.Input />
      <Editable.Preview />
    </Editable.Area>
    <Editable.Context>
      {(editable) => (
        <Editable.Control>
          <Show when={editable().editing} fallback={<Editable.EditTrigger>Edit</Editable.EditTrigger>}>
            <Editable.SubmitTrigger>Save</Editable.SubmitTrigger>
            <Editable.CancelTrigger>Canvel</Editable.CancelTrigger>
          </Show>
        </Editable.Control>
      )}
    </Editable.Context>
  </Editable.Root>
)
```

### Auto-resizing

To auto-grow the editable as the content changes, set the `autoResize` prop to `true`.

```tsx
<Editable.Root placeholder="Placeholder" autoResize>
  {/*...*/}
</Editable.Root>
```

### Max Length

Use the `maxLength` prop to set a maximum number of characters that can be entered into the editable.

```tsx
<Editable.Root placeholder="Placeholder" autoResize maxLength={10}>
  {/*...*/}
</Editable.Root>
```

### Double click activation

The editable supports two modes of activating the "edit" state:

- when the preview part is focused (with pointer or keyboard).
- when the preview part is double-clicked.

To change the mode to double-click, pass the prop `activationMode="dblclick"`.

```tsx
<Editable.Root placeholder="Placeholder" activationMode="dblclick">
  {/*...*/}
</Editable.Root>
```

### Field

The `Field` component helps manage form-related state and accessibility attributes of an editable. It includes handling
ARIA labels, helper text, and error text to ensure proper accessibility.

```tsx
import { Editable } from '@ark-ui/solid/editable'
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'

export const WithField = (props: Field.RootProps) => (
  <Field.Root {...props} readOnly>
    <Editable.Root placeholder="Placeholder" activationMode="dblclick">
      <Editable.Label>Label</Editable.Label>
      <Editable.Area>
        <Editable.Input />
        <Editable.Preview />
      </Editable.Area>
    </Editable.Root>
    <Field.HelperText>Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
)
```

### Root Provider

Use the `useEditable` hook to create the editable store and pass it to the `Editable.RootProvider` component. This
allows you to have maximum control over the editable programmatically.

```tsx
import { Editable, useEditable } from '@ark-ui/solid/editable'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const editable = useEditable({ placeholder: 'Placeholder' })

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => editable().edit()}>Edit</button>

      <Editable.RootProvider value={editable}>
        <Editable.Label>Label</Editable.Label>
        <Editable.Area>
          <Editable.Input />
          <Editable.Preview />
        </Editable.Area>
      </Editable.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

> If you're using the `Editable.RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Editable.Root` component.

# Field



## Examples

The `Field` component provides contexts such as `invalid`, `disabled`, `required`, and `readOnly` for form elements.
While most Ark UI components natively support these contexts, you can also use the `Field` component with standard HTML
form elements.

### Input

This example shows how to use the `Field` component with a standard input field.

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'

export const Input = () => {
  return (
    <Field.Root>
      <Field.Label>Label</Field.Label>
      <Field.Input />
      <Field.HelperText>Some additional Info</Field.HelperText>
      <Field.ErrorText>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
    </Field.Root>
  )
}
```

### Textarea

This example illustrates how to use the `Field` component with a textarea element.

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'

export const Textarea = () => {
  return (
    <Field.Root>
      <Field.Label>Label</Field.Label>
      <Field.Textarea />
      <Field.HelperText>Some additional Info</Field.HelperText>
      <Field.ErrorText>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
    </Field.Root>
  )
}
```

### Textarea Autoresize

Pass the `autoresize` prop to the `Textarea` component to enable automatic resizing as the user types.

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'

export const TextareaAutoresize = () => {
  return (
    <Field.Root>
      <Field.Label>Label</Field.Label>
      <Field.Textarea autoresize />
      <Field.HelperText>Some additional Info</Field.HelperText>
      <Field.ErrorText>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
    </Field.Root>
  )
}
```

### Select

This example demonstrates how to integrate the `Field` component with a select dropdown.

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'

export const Select = () => {
  return (
    <Field.Root>
      <Field.Label>Label</Field.Label>
      <Field.Select>
        <option value="1">Option 1</option>
        <option value="2">Option 2</option>
        <option value="3">Option 3</option>
      </Field.Select>
      <Field.HelperText>Some additional Info</Field.HelperText>
      <Field.ErrorText>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
    </Field.Root>
  )
}
```

### Checkbox

This example demonstrates how to integrate the `Field` and `Checkbox` components.

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/solid/checkbox'
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'
import { CheckIcon, MinusIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

export const WithField = (props: Field.RootProps) => (
  <Field.Root {...props}>
    <Checkbox.Root>
      <Checkbox.Label>Label</Checkbox.Label>
      <Checkbox.Control>
        <Checkbox.Indicator>
          <CheckIcon />
        </Checkbox.Indicator>
        <Checkbox.Indicator indeterminate>
          <MinusIcon />
        </Checkbox.Indicator>
      </Checkbox.Control>
      <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
    </Checkbox.Root>
    <Field.HelperText>Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
)
```

### Root Provider

Use the `useField` hook to create the field store and pass it to the `Field.RootProvider` component. This allows you to
have maximum control over the field programmatically.

```tsx
import { Field, useField } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'
import { createMemo, createSignal } from 'solid-js'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const [invalid, setInvalid] = createSignal(false)
  const fieldProps = createMemo(() => ({
    invalid: invalid(),
  }))
  const value = useField(fieldProps)

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setInvalid((prev) => !prev)}>Toggle Invalid</button>
      <Field.RootProvider value={value}>
        <Field.Label>Label</Field.Label>
        <Field.Input />
        <Field.HelperText>Some additional Info</Field.HelperText>
        <Field.ErrorText>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
      </Field.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

> If you're using the `Field.RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Field.Root` component.

### Custom Control

Use the `Field.Context` or `useFieldContext` hook to access the internal state of the field.This can help you wire up
custom controls with the `Field` component.

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'

export const CustomControl = () => {
  return (
    <Field.Root invalid>
      <Field.Label>Any Control</Field.Label>
      <Field.Context>{(field) => <input {...field().getInputProps()} />}</Field.Context>
      <Field.HelperText>Uses getControlProps() for maximum flexibility</Field.HelperText>
      <Field.ErrorText>This field has an error</Field.ErrorText>
    </Field.Root>
  )
}
```

# Fieldset

## Examples

The `Fieldset` component provides contexts such as `invalid` and `disabled` for form elements. While most Ark UI
components natively support these contexts, you can also use the `Field` component with standard HTML form elements.

### Basic Usage

Learn how to use the `Fieldset` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'
import { Fieldset } from '@ark-ui/solid/fieldset'

export const Basic = () => {
  return (
    <Fieldset.Root>
      <Fieldset.Legend>Legend</Fieldset.Legend>
      <Field.Input type="text" />
      <Fieldset.HelperText>Helper text</Fieldset.HelperText>
      <Fieldset.ErrorText>Error text</Fieldset.ErrorText>
    </Fieldset.Root>
  )
}
```

### Field

This example demonstrates how to use the `Field` component with a standard input field within a `Fieldset`.

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'
import { Fieldset } from '@ark-ui/solid/fieldset'

export const WithField = () => {
  return (
    <Fieldset.Root>
      <Fieldset.Legend>Legend</Fieldset.Legend>
      <Fieldset.HelperText>Fieldset Helper Text</Fieldset.HelperText>
      <Fieldset.ErrorText>Fieldset Error Text</Fieldset.ErrorText>
      <Field.Root>
        <Field.Label>Label</Field.Label>
        <Field.Input />
        <Field.HelperText>Field Helper Text</Field.HelperText>
        <Field.ErrorText>Field Error Text</Field.ErrorText>
      </Field.Root>
    </Fieldset.Root>
  )
}
```

### Checkbox

This example shows how to use the `Fieldset` component with other Ark UI form elements like `Checkbox`.

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from '@ark-ui/solid/checkbox'
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'
import { Fieldset } from '@ark-ui/solid/fieldset'

export const WithCheckbox = () => {
  return (
    <Fieldset.Root>
      <Fieldset.Legend>Legend</Fieldset.Legend>
      <Fieldset.HelperText>Fieldset Helper Text</Fieldset.HelperText>
      <Fieldset.ErrorText>Fieldset Error Text</Fieldset.ErrorText>
      <Field.Root>
        <Checkbox.Root>
          <Checkbox.Label>Label</Checkbox.Label>
          <Checkbox.Control>
            <Checkbox.Indicator>✔️</Checkbox.Indicator>
          </Checkbox.Control>
          <Checkbox.HiddenInput />
        </Checkbox.Root>
        <Field.HelperText>Field Heler Text</Field.HelperText>
        <Field.ErrorText>Field Error Text</Field.ErrorText>
      </Field.Root>
    </Fieldset.Root>
  )
}
```

### Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the fieldset. It accepts the value of the `useFieldset` hook. You
can leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the fieldset.

```tsx
import { Fieldset, useFieldset } from '@ark-ui/solid/fieldset'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const fieldset = useFieldset({
    disabled: true,
  })
  return (
    <Fieldset.RootProvider value={fieldset}>
      <Fieldset.Legend>Legend</Fieldset.Legend>
      <Fieldset.HelperText>Helper text</Fieldset.HelperText>
      <Fieldset.ErrorText>Error text</Fieldset.ErrorText>
    </Fieldset.RootProvider>
  )
}
```

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

### Input with Select

This example shows how to use the `Fieldset` component with `Field.Input` and `Select` to create a interactive phone
input component.

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'
import { Fieldset } from '@ark-ui/solid/fieldset'
import { Select, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/select'
import { Index, createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const PhoneInput = () => {
  const extensions = createListCollection({
    items: ['+1', '+44', '+49', '+41'],
  })

  const [inputRef, setInputRef] = createSignal<HTMLInputElement | null>(null)

  const focusInput = () => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      inputRef()?.focus()
    })
  }

  return (
    <Fieldset.Root style={{ border: '0', padding: '0' }}>
      <Fieldset.Legend onClick={focusInput}>Mobile Number</Fieldset.Legend>

      <div style={{ display: 'flex', 'align-items': 'flex-start' }}>
        <Field.Root>
          <Select.Root collection={extensions} defaultValue={['+1']} onValueChange={focusInput}>
            <Select.Control>
              <Select.Trigger>
                <Select.ValueText placeholder="Select" />
              </Select.Trigger>
            </Select.Control>
            <Portal>
              <Select.Positioner>
                <Select.Content>
                  <Index each={extensions.items}>
                    {(item) => (
                      <Select.Item item={item}>
                        <Select.ItemText>{item()}</Select.ItemText>
                      </Select.Item>
                    )}
                  </Index>
                </Select.Content>
              </Select.Positioner>
            </Portal>
            <Select.HiddenSelect />
          </Select.Root>
        </Field.Root>

        <Field.Root>
          <Field.Input ref={setInputRef} />
        </Field.Root>
      </div>
    </Fieldset.Root>
  )
}
```

# File Upload



## Anatomy

To set up the file upload component correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



## Examples

Learn how to use the `FileUpload` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

```tsx
import { FileUpload } from '@ark-ui/solid/file-upload'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

export const Basic = () => (
  <FileUpload.Root maxFiles={5}>
    <FileUpload.Label>File Upload</FileUpload.Label>
    <FileUpload.Trigger>Choose file(s)</FileUpload.Trigger>
    <FileUpload.ItemGroup>
      <FileUpload.Context>
        {(context) => (
          <For each={context().acceptedFiles}>
            {(file) => (
              <FileUpload.Item file={file}>
                <FileUpload.ItemPreview type="image/*">
                  <FileUpload.ItemPreviewImage />
                </FileUpload.ItemPreview>
                <FileUpload.ItemPreview type=".*">Any Icon</FileUpload.ItemPreview>
                <FileUpload.ItemName />
                <FileUpload.ItemSizeText />
                <FileUpload.ItemDeleteTrigger>X</FileUpload.ItemDeleteTrigger>
              </FileUpload.Item>
            )}
          </For>
        )}
      </FileUpload.Context>
    </FileUpload.ItemGroup>
    <FileUpload.HiddenInput />
  </FileUpload.Root>
)
```

### Initial Files

Use the `defaultAcceptedFiles` prop to set the initial files in the file upload component.

```tsx
import { FileUpload } from '@ark-ui/solid/file-upload'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

export const InitialFiles = () => (
  <FileUpload.Root defaultAcceptedFiles={[new File(['Welcome to Ark UI Solid'], 'README.md', { type: 'text/plain' })]}>
    <FileUpload.Label>File Upload</FileUpload.Label>
    <FileUpload.Trigger>Choose file(s)</FileUpload.Trigger>
    <FileUpload.ItemGroup>
      <FileUpload.Context>
        {(context) => (
          <For each={context().acceptedFiles}>
            {(file) => (
              <FileUpload.Item file={file}>
                <div>📄</div>
                <FileUpload.ItemName />
                <FileUpload.ItemSizeText />
              </FileUpload.Item>
            )}
          </For>
        )}
      </FileUpload.Context>
    </FileUpload.ItemGroup>
    <FileUpload.HiddenInput />
  </FileUpload.Root>
)
```

### Clear Trigger

Use the `ClearTrigger` component to provide users with a way to remove all uploaded files at once. This trigger will
clear both accepted and rejected files from the upload component.

```tsx
import { FileUpload } from '@ark-ui/solid/file-upload'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

export const ClearTrigger = () => (
  <FileUpload.Root maxFiles={5} accept="image/png,image/jpeg">
    <FileUpload.Label>File Upload</FileUpload.Label>
    <FileUpload.Trigger>Choose file(s)</FileUpload.Trigger>
    <FileUpload.ClearTrigger>Clear Files</FileUpload.ClearTrigger>
    <FileUpload.ItemGroup>
      <FileUpload.Context>
        {(context) => (
          <For each={context().acceptedFiles}>
            {(file) => (
              <FileUpload.Item file={file}>
                <FileUpload.ItemPreview type="image/*">
                  <FileUpload.ItemPreviewImage />
                </FileUpload.ItemPreview>
                <FileUpload.ItemName />
              </FileUpload.Item>
            )}
          </For>
        )}
      </FileUpload.Context>
    </FileUpload.ItemGroup>
    <FileUpload.HiddenInput />
  </FileUpload.Root>
)
```

### Drag & Drop

Use the `Dropzone` component to enable drag-and-drop functionality. The dropzone provides adds a `data-dragging`
attribute while dragging for styling purposes.

```tsx
import { FileUpload } from '@ark-ui/solid/file-upload'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

export const DragAndDrop = () => (
  <FileUpload.Root accept="image/*" maxFiles={3}>
    <FileUpload.Dropzone>Drag and drop your images here</FileUpload.Dropzone>

    <FileUpload.ItemGroup>
      <FileUpload.Context>
        {(fileUpload) => (
          <For each={fileUpload().acceptedFiles}>
            {(file) => (
              <FileUpload.Item file={file} class="file-item">
                <FileUpload.ItemPreview type="image/*">
                  <FileUpload.ItemPreviewImage />
                </FileUpload.ItemPreview>
                <FileUpload.ItemName />
              </FileUpload.Item>
            )}
          </For>
        )}
      </FileUpload.Context>
    </FileUpload.ItemGroup>

    <FileUpload.HiddenInput />
  </FileUpload.Root>
)
```

### Directory Upload

Use the `directory` prop to allow users to upload entire folders. This enables selecting multiple files from a directory
structure while preserving the folder hierarchy.

```tsx
import { FileUpload } from '@ark-ui/solid/file-upload'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

export const DirectoryUpload = () => (
  <FileUpload.Root directory>
    <FileUpload.Trigger>Upload Folder</FileUpload.Trigger>
    <FileUpload.ItemGroup>
      <FileUpload.Context>
        {(fileUpload) => (
          <For each={fileUpload().acceptedFiles}>
            {(file) => (
              <FileUpload.Item file={file}>
                <FileUpload.ItemName>{file.webkitRelativePath ?? file.name}</FileUpload.ItemName>
              </FileUpload.Item>
            )}
          </For>
        )}
      </FileUpload.Context>
    </FileUpload.ItemGroup>
    <FileUpload.HiddenInput />
  </FileUpload.Root>
)
```

The `file.webkitRelativePath` property contains the full path of each file within the uploaded directory, allowing you
to display the folder structure or process files based on their location.

> **Important**: When uploading directories with many files, set `maxFiles` to a higher value (e.g., `maxFiles={100}`)
> or remove the limit entirely to prevent files from being rejected due to the default file count restriction.

### Accepted File Types

Use the `accept` prop to restrict the file types that can be uploaded. This prop accepts MIME types (e.g., `image/png`,
`image/jpeg`) or file extensions (e.g., `.pdf`, `.txt`).

When users attempt to upload files that don't match the accepted types, these files will be automatically rejected and
appear in the `rejectedFiles` array with a `FILE_INVALID_TYPE` error code.

```tsx
import { FileUpload } from '@ark-ui/solid/file-upload'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

export const AcceptedFileTypes = () => (
  <FileUpload.Root accept="image/png,image/jpeg">
    <FileUpload.Label>File Upload (PNG and JPEG only)</FileUpload.Label>
    <FileUpload.Dropzone>Drop your files here</FileUpload.Dropzone>
    <FileUpload.Trigger>Select Files</FileUpload.Trigger>

    <FileUpload.ItemGroup>
      <FileUpload.Context>
        {(context) => (
          <For each={context().acceptedFiles}>
            {(file) => (
              <FileUpload.Item file={file}>
                <FileUpload.ItemName />
                <FileUpload.ItemSizeText />
                <FileUpload.ItemDeleteTrigger>Remove</FileUpload.ItemDeleteTrigger>
              </FileUpload.Item>
            )}
          </For>
        )}
      </FileUpload.Context>
    </FileUpload.ItemGroup>

    <FileUpload.ItemGroup>
      <FileUpload.Context>
        {(context) => (
          <For each={context().rejectedFiles}>
            {(fileRejection) => (
              <FileUpload.Item file={fileRejection.file}>
                <FileUpload.ItemName />
                <FileUpload.ItemSizeText />
                <div>
                  <For each={fileRejection.errors}>{(error) => <div style={{ color: 'red' }}>{error}</div>}</For>
                </div>
              </FileUpload.Item>
            )}
          </For>
        )}
      </FileUpload.Context>
    </FileUpload.ItemGroup>

    <FileUpload.HiddenInput />
  </FileUpload.Root>
)
```

### Error Handling

The `FileUpload` component provides comprehensive validation and error handling capabilities. You can set various
constraints and handle different types of validation errors:

**Built-in Validation Props:**

- `maxFiles` - Maximum number of files allowed
- `maxFileSize` - Maximum file size in bytes
- `minFileSize` - Minimum file size in bytes
- `accept` - Allowed MIME types or file extensions

**Built-in Error Types:**

- `TOO_MANY_FILES` - Exceeds maxFiles limit
- `FILE_INVALID_TYPE` - File type not in accept list
- `FILE_TOO_LARGE` - File size exceeds maxFileSize
- `FILE_TOO_SMALL` - File size below minFileSize
- `FILE_INVALID` - Generic validation failure
- `FILE_EXISTS` - Duplicate file detected

```tsx
import { FileUpload, type FileUploadFileError } from '@ark-ui/solid/file-upload'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

const errorMessages: Record<FileUploadFileError, string> = {
  TOO_MANY_FILES: '📊 Too many files selected (max 3 allowed)',
  FILE_INVALID_TYPE: '🚫 Invalid file type (only images and PDFs allowed)',
  FILE_TOO_LARGE: '📏 File too large (max 1MB)',
  FILE_TOO_SMALL: '📐 File too small (min 1KB)',
  FILE_INVALID: '⚠️ Invalid file',
  FILE_EXISTS: '🔄 File already exists',
}

export const ErrorHandling = () => (
  <FileUpload.Root
    maxFiles={3}
    maxFileSize={1024 * 1024} // 1MB
    minFileSize={1024} // 1KB
    accept="image/*,application/pdf"
  >
    <FileUpload.Label>File Upload with Validation</FileUpload.Label>
    <FileUpload.Trigger>Select Files</FileUpload.Trigger>

    {/* Accepted Files Section */}
    <div data-status="accepted">
      <h3>✅ Accepted Files</h3>
      <FileUpload.ItemGroup>
        <FileUpload.Context>
          {(fileUpload) =>
            fileUpload().acceptedFiles.length === 0 ? (
              <div>No files uploaded yet</div>
            ) : (
              <For each={fileUpload().acceptedFiles}>

                      <FileUpload.ItemPreviewImage />
                    </FileUpload.ItemPreview>
                    <FileUpload.ItemPreview type="application/pdf">

                  </FileUpload.Item>
                )}
              </For>
            )
          }
        </FileUpload.Context>
      </FileUpload.ItemGroup>
    </div>

    {/* Rejected Files Section */}
    <div data-status="rejected">
      <h3>❌ Rejected Files</h3>
      <FileUpload.ItemGroup>
        <FileUpload.Context>
          {(fileUpload) =>
            fileUpload().rejectedFiles.length === 0 ? (
              <div>No rejected files</div>
            ) : (
              <For each={fileUpload().rejectedFiles}>
                {(fileRejection) => (
                  <FileUpload.Item file={fileRejection.file} class="file-item" data-status="rejected">
                    <FileUpload.ItemName />
                    <FileUpload.ItemSizeText />
                    <div>
                      <strong>Validation Errors:</strong>
                      <For each={fileRejection.errors}>
                        {(error) => <div data-error-code={error}>{errorMessages[error] || `❓ ${error}`}</div>}
                      </For>
                    </div>
                  </FileUpload.Item>
                )}
              </For>
            )
          }
        </FileUpload.Context>
      </FileUpload.ItemGroup>
    </div>

    <FileUpload.HiddenInput />
  </FileUpload.Root>
)
```

### File Transformations

Use the `transformFiles` prop to process files before they're added to the accepted files list. This is useful for file
compression, format conversion, or adding metadata.

**Common transformation use cases:**

- **Image compression**: Use `image-conversion`, `browser-image-compression`, or similar libraries
- **Format conversion**: Convert files to different formats (e.g., HEIC to JPEG)
- **Metadata extraction**: Add EXIF data or other file information
- **File validation**: Perform additional checks beyond basic validation
- **Resizing**: Automatically resize images to specific dimensions

```tsx
import { FileUpload } from '@ark-ui/solid/file-upload'
import { compressAccurately } from 'image-conversion'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

export const FileTransformations = () => {
  const transformFiles = async (files: File[]) => {
    return Promise.all(
      files.map(async (file) => {
        if (file.type.startsWith('image/')) {
          try {
            const blob = await compressAccurately(file, 200)
            return new File([blob], file.name, { type: blob.type })
          } catch (error) {
            console.error('Compression failed for:', file.name, error)
            return file
          }
        }
        return file
      }),
    )
  }

  return (
    <FileUpload.Root accept="image/*" maxFiles={5} transformFiles={transformFiles}>
      <FileUpload.Label>File Upload with Compression</FileUpload.Label>
      <FileUpload.Trigger>Choose Images</FileUpload.Trigger>

      <FileUpload.ItemGroup>
        <FileUpload.Context>
          {(fileUpload) => (
            <For each={fileUpload().acceptedFiles}>
              {(file) => (
                <FileUpload.Item file={file} class="file-item">
                  <FileUpload.ItemPreview type="image/*">
                    <FileUpload.ItemPreviewImage />
                  </FileUpload.ItemPreview>
                  <FileUpload.ItemName />
                  <FileUpload.ItemSizeText />
                  <FileUpload.ItemDeleteTrigger>Remove</FileUpload.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                </FileUpload.Item>
              )}
            </For>
          )}
        </FileUpload.Context>
      </FileUpload.ItemGroup>

      <FileUpload.HiddenInput />
    </FileUpload.Root>
  )
}
```

### Custom Validation

Use the `validate` prop to implement custom validation logic beyond the built-in constraints.

```tsx
import { FileUpload } from '@ark-ui/solid/file-upload'
import { FileIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

export const WithValidation = () => {
  return (
    <FileUpload.Root
      validate={(file) => {
        if (file.name.length > 20) return ['FILE_NAME_TOO_LONG']
        return null
      }}
    >
      <FileUpload.Trigger>Choose file(s)</FileUpload.Trigger>
      <FileUpload.ItemGroup>
        <FileUpload.Context>
          {(context) => (
            <For each={context().acceptedFiles}>
              {(file) => (
                <FileUpload.Item file={file}>
                  <FileUpload.ItemPreview type="image/*">
                    <FileUpload.ItemPreviewImage />
                  </FileUpload.ItemPreview>
                  <FileUpload.ItemPreview type=".*">
                    <FileIcon />
                  </FileUpload.ItemPreview>
                  <FileUpload.ItemName />
                  <FileUpload.ItemSizeText />
                  <FileUpload.ItemDeleteTrigger>X</FileUpload.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                </FileUpload.Item>
              )}
            </For>
          )}
        </FileUpload.Context>
      </FileUpload.ItemGroup>
      <FileUpload.HiddenInput />
    </FileUpload.Root>
  )
}
```

### Field

Here's an example of how to use the `FileUpload` component with the `Field` component to provide a error and helper
text.

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'
import { FileUpload } from '@ark-ui/solid/file-upload'

export const WithField = (props: Field.RootProps) => (
  <Field.Root {...props}>
    <FileUpload.Root maxFiles={5}>
      <FileUpload.Label>Label</FileUpload.Label>
      <FileUpload.Trigger>Select</FileUpload.Trigger>
      <FileUpload.ItemGroup />
      <FileUpload.HiddenInput data-testid="input" />
    </FileUpload.Root>
    <Field.HelperText>Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
)
```

### Root Provider

Use the `useFileUpload` hook to create the file upload store and pass it to the `RootProvider` component. This allows
you to have maximum control over the file upload programmatically.

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

```tsx
import { FileUpload, useFileUpload } from '@ark-ui/solid/file-upload'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const fileUpload = useFileUpload({ maxFiles: 5 })

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => fileUpload().clearFiles()}>Clear</button>

      <FileUpload.RootProvider value={fileUpload}>
        <FileUpload.Label>File Upload</FileUpload.Label>
        <FileUpload.Dropzone>Drag your file(s)here</FileUpload.Dropzone>
        <FileUpload.Trigger>Choose file(s)</FileUpload.Trigger>
        <FileUpload.ItemGroup>
          <FileUpload.Context>
            {(context) => (
              <For each={context().acceptedFiles}>
                {(file) => (
                  <FileUpload.Item file={file}>
                    <FileUpload.ItemPreview type="image/*">
                      <FileUpload.ItemPreviewImage />
                    </FileUpload.ItemPreview>
                    <FileUpload.ItemPreview type=".*">Any Icon</FileUpload.ItemPreview>
                    <FileUpload.ItemName />
                    <FileUpload.ItemSizeText />
                    <FileUpload.ItemDeleteTrigger>X</FileUpload.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                  </FileUpload.Item>
                )}
              </For>
            )}
          </FileUpload.Context>
        </FileUpload.ItemGroup>
        <FileUpload.HiddenInput />
      </FileUpload.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Pasting Files

Use the `setClipboardFiles` method to enable pasting images directly from the clipboard.

> You can access the `fileUpload` store from `FileUpload.Context` as well.

```tsx
import { FileUpload, useFileUpload } from '@ark-ui/solid/file-upload'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

export const WithPaste = () => {
  const fileUpload = useFileUpload({ maxFiles: 3, accept: 'image/*' })

  return (
    <FileUpload.RootProvider value={fileUpload}>
      <FileUpload.Label>File Upload with Paste</FileUpload.Label>
      <textarea
        placeholder="Paste image here..."
        onPaste={(e) => {
          fileUpload().setClipboardFiles(e.clipboardData)
        }}
      />
      <FileUpload.ItemGroup>
        <For each={fileUpload().acceptedFiles}>
          {(file) => (
            <FileUpload.Item file={file}>
              <FileUpload.ItemPreview type="image/*">
                <FileUpload.ItemPreviewImage />
              </FileUpload.ItemPreview>
              <FileUpload.ItemDeleteTrigger>X</FileUpload.ItemDeleteTrigger>
            </FileUpload.Item>
          )}
        </For>
      </FileUpload.ItemGroup>
      <FileUpload.HiddenInput />
    </FileUpload.RootProvider>
  )
}
```

## Guides

### File Previews

The `FileUpload` component provides flexible preview options for different file types. Use `ItemPreview` with type
matching to show appropriate previews based on file format.

**Preview Types:**

- `type="image/*"`: Shows image thumbnails using `ItemPreviewImage`
- `type="video/*"`: For video file previews
- `type="application/pdf"`: For PDF files
- `type=".*"`: Generic fallback for any file type

```tsx
<FileUpload.ItemPreview type="image/*">
  <FileUpload.ItemPreviewImage />
</FileUpload.ItemPreview>

<FileUpload.ItemPreview type="video/*">
  <VideoIcon />
</FileUpload.ItemPreview>

<FileUpload.ItemPreview type="application/pdf">
  <PdfIcon />
</FileUpload.ItemPreview>

<FileUpload.ItemPreview type=".*">
  <FileIcon />
</FileUpload.ItemPreview>
```

**File Metadata Display:**

- `ItemName` - Shows the file name
- `ItemSizeText` - Shows formatted file size (e.g., "2.5 MB")

### Disable dropzone

To disable drag-and-drop functionality, set the `allowDrop` prop to `false`.

```tsx
<FileUpload.Root allowDrop={false}>{/* ... */}</FileUpload.Root>
```

### Prevent document drop

By default, when the dropzone is active, we prevent accidental navigation when files are dropped outside the dropzone.
To prevent this behavior, set the `preventDocumentDrop` prop to `false`.

```tsx
<FileUpload.Root preventDocumentDrop={false}>{/* ... */}</FileUpload.Root>
```

### Prevent double open

When you want to delegate clicking to the trigger and remove the dropzone from the tab order, you can use the
`disableClick` prop. This prevents the the file picker from opening twice.

```tsx
<FileUpload.Dropzone disableClick>
  <FileUpload.Trigger>Choose Files</FileUpload.Trigger>
  Drag files here
</FileUpload.Dropzone>
```

# Floating Panel



## Anatomy

To set up the editable correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



## Examples

Learn how to use the `FloatingPanel` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

```tsx
import { FloatingPanel } from '@ark-ui/solid/floating-panel'
import { ArrowDownLeft, Maximize2, Minus, XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const Basic = () => (
  <FloatingPanel.Root>
    <FloatingPanel.Trigger>Toggle Panel</FloatingPanel.Trigger>
    <Portal>
      <FloatingPanel.Positioner>
        <FloatingPanel.Content>
          <FloatingPanel.DragTrigger>
            <FloatingPanel.Header>
              <FloatingPanel.Title>Floating Panel</FloatingPanel.Title>
              <FloatingPanel.Control>
                <FloatingPanel.StageTrigger stage="minimized">
                  <Minus />
                </FloatingPanel.StageTrigger>
                <FloatingPanel.StageTrigger stage="maximized">
                  <Maximize2 />
                </FloatingPanel.StageTrigger>
                <FloatingPanel.StageTrigger stage="default">
                  <ArrowDownLeft />
                </FloatingPanel.StageTrigger>
                <FloatingPanel.CloseTrigger>
                  <XIcon />
                </FloatingPanel.CloseTrigger>
              </FloatingPanel.Control>
            </FloatingPanel.Header>
          </FloatingPanel.DragTrigger>
          <FloatingPanel.Body>
            <p>Some content</p>
          </FloatingPanel.Body>

          <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="n" />
          <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="e" />
          <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="w" />
          <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="s" />
          <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="ne" />
          <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="se" />
          <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="sw" />
          <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="nw" />
        </FloatingPanel.Content>
      </FloatingPanel.Positioner>
    </Portal>
  </FloatingPanel.Root>
)
```

### Controlling the size

To control the size of the floating panel programmatically, you can pass the `size` `onResize` prop to the machine.

```tsx
import { FloatingPanel } from '@ark-ui/solid/floating-panel'
import { ArrowDownLeft, Maximize2, Minus, XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const ControlledSize = () => {
  const [size, setSize] = createSignal({ width: 400, height: 300 })

  return (
    <FloatingPanel.Root size={size()} onSizeChange={(e) => setSize(e.size)}>
      <FloatingPanel.Trigger>Toggle Panel</FloatingPanel.Trigger>
      <Portal>
        <FloatingPanel.Positioner>
          <FloatingPanel.Content>
            <FloatingPanel.DragTrigger>
              <FloatingPanel.Header>
                <FloatingPanel.Title>Floating Panel</FloatingPanel.Title>
                <FloatingPanel.Control>
                  <FloatingPanel.StageTrigger stage="minimized">
                    <Minus />
                  </FloatingPanel.StageTrigger>
                  <FloatingPanel.StageTrigger stage="maximized">
                    <Maximize2 />
                  </FloatingPanel.StageTrigger>
                  <FloatingPanel.StageTrigger stage="default">
                    <ArrowDownLeft />
                  </FloatingPanel.StageTrigger>
                  <FloatingPanel.CloseTrigger>
                    <XIcon />
                  </FloatingPanel.CloseTrigger>
                </FloatingPanel.Control>
              </FloatingPanel.Header>
            </FloatingPanel.DragTrigger>
            <FloatingPanel.Body>
              <p>Some content</p>
            </FloatingPanel.Body>

            <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="n" />
            <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="e" />
            <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="w" />
            <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="s" />
            <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="ne" />
            <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="se" />
            <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="sw" />
            <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="nw" />
          </FloatingPanel.Content>
        </FloatingPanel.Positioner>
      </Portal>
    </FloatingPanel.Root>
  )
}
```

### Controlling the position

To control the position of the floating panel programmatically, you can pass the `position` and `onPositionChange` prop
to the machine.

```tsx
import { FloatingPanel } from '@ark-ui/solid/floating-panel'
import { ArrowDownLeft, Maximize2, Minus, XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const ControlledPosition = () => {
  const [position, setPosition] = createSignal({ x: 200, y: 200 })

  return (
    <FloatingPanel.Root position={position()} onPositionChange={(e) => setPosition(e.position)}>
      <FloatingPanel.Trigger>Toggle Panel</FloatingPanel.Trigger>
      <Portal>
        <FloatingPanel.Positioner>
          <FloatingPanel.Content>
            <FloatingPanel.DragTrigger>
              <FloatingPanel.Header>
                <FloatingPanel.Title>Floating Panel</FloatingPanel.Title>
                <FloatingPanel.Control>
                  <FloatingPanel.StageTrigger stage="minimized">
                    <Minus />
                  </FloatingPanel.StageTrigger>
                  <FloatingPanel.StageTrigger stage="maximized">
                    <Maximize2 />
                  </FloatingPanel.StageTrigger>
                  <FloatingPanel.StageTrigger stage="default">
                    <ArrowDownLeft />
                  </FloatingPanel.StageTrigger>
                  <FloatingPanel.CloseTrigger>
                    <XIcon />
                  </FloatingPanel.CloseTrigger>
                </FloatingPanel.Control>
              </FloatingPanel.Header>
            </FloatingPanel.DragTrigger>
            <FloatingPanel.Body>
              <p>Some content</p>
            </FloatingPanel.Body>

            <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="n" />
            <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="e" />
            <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="w" />
            <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="s" />
            <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="ne" />
            <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="se" />
            <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="sw" />
            <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="nw" />
          </FloatingPanel.Content>
        </FloatingPanel.Positioner>
      </Portal>
    </FloatingPanel.Root>
  )
}
```

### Anchor position

Use the `getAnchorPosition` function to compute the initial position of the floating panel. This function is called when
the panel is opened and receives the `triggerRect` and `boundaryRect`.

```tsx
import { FloatingPanel } from '@ark-ui/solid/floating-panel'
import { ArrowDownLeft, Maximize2, Minus, XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const AnchorPosition = () => (
  <FloatingPanel.Root
    getAnchorPosition={({ triggerRect }) => {
      if (!triggerRect) return { x: 0, y: 0 }
      return {
        x: triggerRect.x + triggerRect.width / 2,
        y: triggerRect.y + triggerRect.height / 2,
      }
    }}
  >
    <FloatingPanel.Trigger>Toggle Panel</FloatingPanel.Trigger>
    <Portal>
      <FloatingPanel.Positioner>
        <FloatingPanel.Content>
          <FloatingPanel.DragTrigger>
            <FloatingPanel.Header>
              <FloatingPanel.Title>Floating Panel</FloatingPanel.Title>
              <FloatingPanel.Control>
                <FloatingPanel.StageTrigger stage="minimized">
                  <Minus />
                </FloatingPanel.StageTrigger>
                <FloatingPanel.StageTrigger stage="maximized">
                  <Maximize2 />
                </FloatingPanel.StageTrigger>
                <FloatingPanel.StageTrigger stage="default">
                  <ArrowDownLeft />
                </FloatingPanel.StageTrigger>
                <FloatingPanel.CloseTrigger>
                  <XIcon />
                </FloatingPanel.CloseTrigger>
              </FloatingPanel.Control>
            </FloatingPanel.Header>
          </FloatingPanel.DragTrigger>
          <FloatingPanel.Body>
            <p>Some content</p>
          </FloatingPanel.Body>

          <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="n" />
          <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="e" />
          <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="w" />
          <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="s" />
          <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="ne" />
          <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="se" />
          <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="sw" />
          <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="nw" />
        </FloatingPanel.Content>
      </FloatingPanel.Positioner>
    </Portal>
  </FloatingPanel.Root>
)
```

### Controlling the open state

To control the open state of the floating panel programmatically, you can pass the `open` and `onOpenChange` prop to the
machine.

```tsx
import { FloatingPanel } from '@ark-ui/solid/floating-panel'
import { ArrowDownLeft, Maximize2, Minus, XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const ControlledOpen = () => {
  const [open, setOpen] = createSignal(false)

  return (
    <FloatingPanel.Root open={open()} onOpenChange={(e) => setOpen(e.open)}>
      <FloatingPanel.Trigger>Toggle Panel</FloatingPanel.Trigger>
      <Portal>
        <FloatingPanel.Positioner>
          <FloatingPanel.Content>
            <FloatingPanel.DragTrigger>
              <FloatingPanel.Header>
                <FloatingPanel.Title>Floating Panel</FloatingPanel.Title>
                <FloatingPanel.Control>
                  <FloatingPanel.StageTrigger stage="minimized">
                    <Minus />
                  </FloatingPanel.StageTrigger>
                  <FloatingPanel.StageTrigger stage="maximized">
                    <Maximize2 />
                  </FloatingPanel.StageTrigger>
                  <FloatingPanel.StageTrigger stage="default">
                    <ArrowDownLeft />
                  </FloatingPanel.StageTrigger>
                  <FloatingPanel.CloseTrigger>
                    <XIcon />
                  </FloatingPanel.CloseTrigger>
                </FloatingPanel.Control>
              </FloatingPanel.Header>
            </FloatingPanel.DragTrigger>
            <FloatingPanel.Body>

            <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="sw" />
            <FloatingPanel.ResizeTrigger axis="nw" />
          </FloatingPanel.Content>
        </FloatingPanel.Positioner>
      </Portal>
    </FloatingPanel.Root>
  )
}
```

### Lazy mounting

To lazy mount the floating panel, you can pass the `lazyMount` prop to the machine.

```tsx
import { FloatingPanel } from '@ark-ui/solid/floating-panel'

export const LazyMount = () => (
  <FloatingPanel.Root lazyMount onExitComplete={() => console.log('onExitComplete invoked')}>
    <FloatingPanel.Trigger>Toggle Panel</FloatingPanel.Trigger>
    <Portal>
      <FloatingPanel.Positioner>
        <FloatingPanel.Content>
          <FloatingPanel.DragTrigger>
            <FloatingPanel.Header>
              <FloatingPanel.Title>Floating Panel</FloatingPanel.Title>

      </FloatingPanel.Positioner>
    </Portal>
  </FloatingPanel.Root>
)
```

# Hover Card



## Anatomy

To set up the hover card correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



## Examples

Learn how to use the `HoverCard` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

```tsx
import { HoverCard } from '@ark-ui/solid/hover-card'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const Basic = () => (
  <HoverCard.Root>
    <HoverCard.Trigger>Hover me</HoverCard.Trigger>
    <Portal>
      <HoverCard.Positioner>
        <HoverCard.Content>
          <HoverCard.Arrow>
            <HoverCard.ArrowTip />
          </HoverCard.Arrow>
          Content
        </HoverCard.Content>
      </HoverCard.Positioner>
    </Portal>
  </HoverCard.Root>
)
```

### Controlled HoverCard

The controlled `HoverCard` component provides an interface for managing the state of the hover card using the `open` and
`onOpenChange` props:

```tsx
import { HoverCard } from '@ark-ui/solid/hover-card'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [isOpen, setOpen] = createSignal(false)
  return (
    <>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => setOpen(!isOpen)}>
        click me
      </button>
      <HoverCard.Root open={isOpen()} onOpenChange={() => setOpen(false)}>
        <HoverCard.Trigger>Hover me</HoverCard.Trigger>
        <Portal>
          <HoverCard.Positioner>
            <HoverCard.Content>
              <HoverCard.Arrow>
                <HoverCard.ArrowTip />
              </HoverCard.Arrow>
              Content
            </HoverCard.Content>
          </HoverCard.Positioner>
        </Portal>
      </HoverCard.Root>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Custom Positioning

The `HoverCard` component can be customized in its placement and distance from the trigger element through the
`positioning` prop:

```tsx
import { HoverCard } from '@ark-ui/solid/hover-card'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const Positioning = () => (
  <HoverCard.Root positioning={{ placement: 'right', gutter: 12 }}>
    <HoverCard.Trigger>Hover me</HoverCard.Trigger>
    <Portal>
      <HoverCard.Positioner>
        <HoverCard.Content>
          <HoverCard.Arrow>
            <HoverCard.ArrowTip />
          </HoverCard.Arrow>
          Content
        </HoverCard.Content>
      </HoverCard.Positioner>
    </Portal>
  </HoverCard.Root>
)
```

### Render Prop Usage

The `HoverCard` component can also accept a render prop, giving the user more control over rendering behavior. This is
useful for dynamically updating the trigger based on the state of the `HoverCard`:

```tsx
import { HoverCard } from '@ark-ui/solid/hover-card'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const RenderProp = () => (
  <HoverCard.Root>
    <HoverCard.Context>
      {(context) => <HoverCard.Trigger>Hover me {context().open ? '▲' : '▼'} </HoverCard.Trigger>}
    </HoverCard.Context>
    <Portal>
      <HoverCard.Positioner>
        <HoverCard.Content>
          <HoverCard.Arrow>
            <HoverCard.ArrowTip />
          </HoverCard.Arrow>
          Content
        </HoverCard.Content>
      </HoverCard.Positioner>
    </Portal>
  </HoverCard.Root>
)
```

### Using the Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the hover-card. It accepts the value of the `useHover-card` hook.
You can leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the hover-card.

```tsx
import { HoverCard, useHoverCard } from '@ark-ui/solid/hover-card'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const hoverCard = useHoverCard()

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => hoverCard().setOpen(true)}>Open</button>

      <HoverCard.RootProvider value={hoverCard}>
        <HoverCard.Trigger>Hover me</HoverCard.Trigger>
        <Portal>
          <HoverCard.Positioner>
            <HoverCard.Content>
              <HoverCard.Arrow>
                <HoverCard.ArrowTip />
              </HoverCard.Arrow>
              Content
            </HoverCard.Content>
          </HoverCard.Positioner>
        </Portal>
      </HoverCard.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

# Listbox



## Anatomy

To set up the Listbox correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

{/*  */}

## Examples

### Basic

Here's a basic example of the Listbox component.

```tsx
import { Listbox, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/listbox'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const Basic = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({ items: ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte'] })

  return (
    <Listbox.Root collection={collection}>
      <Listbox.Label>Select your Framework</Listbox.Label>
      <Listbox.Content>
        <Index each={collection.items}>
          {(item) => (
            <Listbox.Item item={item()}>
              <Listbox.ItemText>{item()}</Listbox.ItemText>
              <Listbox.ItemIndicator />
            </Listbox.Item>
          )}
        </Index>
      </Listbox.Content>
    </Listbox.Root>
  )
}
```

### Controlled

The Listbox component can be controlled by using the `value` and `onValueChange` props. This allows you to manage the
selected value externally.

```tsx
import { Listbox, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/listbox'
import { Index, createSignal } from 'solid-js'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({ items: ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte'] })
  const [value, setValue] = createSignal(['React'])

  return (
    <Listbox.Root value={value()} onValueChange={(e) => setValue(e.value)} collection={collection}>
      <Listbox.Label>Select your Framework</Listbox.Label>
      <Listbox.Content>
        <Index each={collection.items}>
          {(item) => (
            <Listbox.Item item={item()}>
              <Listbox.ItemText>{item()}</Listbox.ItemText>
              <Listbox.ItemIndicator />
            </Listbox.Item>
          )}
        </Index>
      </Listbox.Content>
    </Listbox.Root>
  )
}
```

### Disabled Item

Listbox items can be disabled using the `disabled` prop on the collection item.

```tsx
import { Listbox, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/listbox'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const Disabled = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({
    items: [
      { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
      { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
      { label: 'Svelte', value: 'svelte', disabled: true },
      { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
    ],
  })

  return (
    <Listbox.Root collection={collection}>
      <Listbox.Label>Select your Framework</Listbox.Label>
      <Listbox.Content>
        <Index each={collection.items}>
          {(item) => (
            <Listbox.Item item={item()}>
              <Listbox.ItemText>{item().label}</Listbox.ItemText>
              <Listbox.ItemIndicator />
            </Listbox.Item>
          )}
        </Index>
      </Listbox.Content>
    </Listbox.Root>
  )
}
```

> You can also use the `isItemDisabled` within the `createListCollection` to disable items based on a condition.

### Multiple Selection

You can set the `selectionMode` property as `multiple` to allow the user to select multiple items at a time.

```tsx
import { Listbox, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/listbox'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const Multiple = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({ items: ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte'] })

  return (
    <Listbox.Root collection={collection} selectionMode="multiple">
      <Listbox.Label>Select your Framework</Listbox.Label>
      <Listbox.Content>
        <Index each={collection.items}>
          {(item) => (
            <Listbox.Item item={item()}>
              <Listbox.ItemText>{item()}</Listbox.ItemText>
              <Listbox.ItemIndicator />
            </Listbox.Item>
          )}
        </Index>
      </Listbox.Content>
    </Listbox.Root>
  )
}
```

### Grouping

The Listbox component supports grouping items. You can use the `groupBy` function to group items based on a specific
property.

```tsx
import { Listbox, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/listbox'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

export const Group = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({
    items: [
      { label: 'React', value: 'react', type: 'JS' },
      { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid', type: 'JS' },
      { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue', type: 'JS' },
      { label: 'Panda', value: 'panda', type: 'CSS' },
      { label: 'Tailwind', value: 'tailwind', type: 'CSS' },
    ],
    groupBy: (item) => item.type,
  })

  return (
    <Listbox.Root collection={collection}>
      <Listbox.Label>Select your Frameworks</Listbox.Label>
      <Listbox.Content>
        <For each={collection.group()}>
          {([type, group]) => (
            <Listbox.ItemGroup>
              <Listbox.ItemGroupLabel>{type}</Listbox.ItemGroupLabel>
              <For each={group}>
                {(item) => (
                  <Listbox.Item item={item}>
                    <Listbox.ItemText>{item.label}</Listbox.ItemText>
                    <Listbox.ItemIndicator />
                  </Listbox.Item>
                )}
              </For>
            </Listbox.ItemGroup>
          )}
        </For>
      </Listbox.Content>
    </Listbox.Root>
  )
}
```

## Guides

### Type-Safety

The `Listbox.RootComponent` type enables you to create closed, strongly typed wrapper components that maintain full type
safety for collection items.

This is particularly useful when building reusable listbox components with custom props and consistent styling.

```tsx
import { Listbox as ArkListbox, type CollectionItem } from '@ark-ui/react/listbox'
import { createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/collection'

interface ListboxProps<T extends CollectionItem> extends ArkListbox.RootProps<T> {}

const Listbox: ArkListbox.RootComponent = (props) => {
  return <ArkListbox.Root {...props}>{/* ... */}</ArkListbox.Root>
}
```

Then, you can use the `Listbox` component as follows:

```tsx
const App = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({
    initialItems: [
      { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
      { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
      { label: 'Svelte', value: 'svelte' },
    ],
  })
  return (
    <Listbox
      collection={collection}
      onValueChange={(e) => {
        // this will be strongly typed Array<{ label: string, value: string }>
        console.log(e.items)
      }}
    >
      {/* ... */}
    </Listbox>
  )
}
```

# Menu



## Anatomy

To set up the menu correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



## Examples

Learn how to use the `Menu` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

```tsx
import { Menu } from '@ark-ui/solid/menu'

export const Basic = () => (
  <Menu.Root>
    <Menu.Trigger>
      Open menu <Menu.Indicator>➡️</Menu.Indicator>
    </Menu.Trigger>
    <Menu.Positioner>
      <Menu.Content>
        <Menu.Item value="react">React</Menu.Item>
        <Menu.Item value="solid">Solid</Menu.Item>
        <Menu.Item value="vue">Vue</Menu.Item>
      </Menu.Content>
    </Menu.Positioner>
  </Menu.Root>
)
```

### Listening to item selection

Pass the `onSelect` prop to the Menu component to perform some custom logic when an item is selected. The callback is
invoked with the `id` of the item.

```tsx
import { Menu } from '@ark-ui/solid/menu'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = createSignal(false)

  return (
    <>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => setIsOpen(!isOpen())}>
        Trigger from the outside
      </button>
      <Menu.Root open={isOpen()} onSelect={(id) => console.log(id)}>
        <Menu.Trigger>
          Open menu <Menu.Indicator>➡️</Menu.Indicator>
        </Menu.Trigger>
        <Menu.Positioner>
          <Menu.Content>
            <Menu.Item value="react">React</Menu.Item>
            <Menu.Item value="solid">Solid</Menu.Item>
            <Menu.Item value="vue">Vue</Menu.Item>
          </Menu.Content>
        </Menu.Positioner>
      </Menu.Root>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Grouping menu items

When the number of menu items gets much, it might be useful to group related menu items. To achieve this, render the
`Menu.ItemGroup` component around the `Menu.Item` components. The `Menu.ItemGroupLabel` component can be used to add a
label to the group.

```tsx
import { Menu } from '@ark-ui/solid/menu'

export const Group = () => (
  <Menu.Root>
    <Menu.Trigger>Open menu</Menu.Trigger>
    <Menu.Positioner>
      <Menu.Content>
        <Menu.ItemGroup>
          <Menu.ItemGroupLabel>JS Frameworks</Menu.ItemGroupLabel>
          <Menu.Item value="react">React</Menu.Item>
          <Menu.Item value="solid">Solid</Menu.Item>
          <Menu.Item value="vue">Vue</Menu.Item>
        </Menu.ItemGroup>
        <Menu.ItemGroup>
          <Menu.ItemGroupLabel>CSS Frameworks</Menu.ItemGroupLabel>
          <Menu.Item value="panda">Panda</Menu.Item>
          <Menu.Item value="tailwind">Tailwind</Menu.Item>
        </Menu.ItemGroup>
      </Menu.Content>
    </Menu.Positioner>
  </Menu.Root>
)
```

### Separating menu items

To separate menu items, render the `Menu.Separator` component.

```tsx
import { Menu } from '@ark-ui/solid/menu'

export const Separator = () => (
  <Menu.Root>
    <Menu.Trigger>Open menu</Menu.Trigger>
    <Menu.Positioner>
      <Menu.Content>
        <Menu.Item value="react">React</Menu.Item>
        <Menu.Item value="solid">Solid</Menu.Item>
        <Menu.Separator />
        <Menu.Item value="vue">Vue</Menu.Item>
        <Menu.Item value="svelte">Svelte</Menu.Item>
      </Menu.Content>
    </Menu.Positioner>
  </Menu.Root>
)
```

### Menu with links

To render menu items as links, use the `asChild` prop to replace the default element with an anchor tag.

```tsx
import { Menu } from '@ark-ui/solid/menu'

export const Links = () => (
  <Menu.Root>
    <Menu.Trigger>Open menu</Menu.Trigger>
    <Menu.Positioner>
      <Menu.Content>
        <Menu.Item value="docs" asChild={(props) => <a href="https://ark-ui.com" {...props()} />}>
          Documentation
        </Menu.Item>
        <Menu.Item value="github" asChild={(props) => <a href="https://github.com/chakra-ui/ark" {...props()} />}>
          GitHub
        </Menu.Item>
        <Menu.Item value="twitter" asChild={(props) => <a href="https://twitter.com/ark_ui_" {...props()} />}>
          Twitter
        </Menu.Item>
      </Menu.Content>
    </Menu.Positioner>
  </Menu.Root>
)
```

### Context menu

To show the menu when a trigger element is right-clicked, use the `Menu.ContextTrigger` component.

Context menus are also opened during a long-press of roughly `700ms` when the pointer is pen or touch.

```tsx
import { Menu } from '@ark-ui/solid/menu'

export const Context = () => (
  <Menu.Root>
    <Menu.ContextTrigger>Right click me</Menu.ContextTrigger>
    <Menu.Positioner>
      <Menu.Content>
        <Menu.Item value="react">React</Menu.Item>
        <Menu.Item value="solid">Solid</Menu.Item>
        <Menu.Item value="vue">Vue</Menu.Item>
      </Menu.Content>
    </Menu.Positioner>
  </Menu.Root>
)
```

### Nested menu

To show a nested menu, render another `Menu` component and use the `Menu.TriggerItem` component to open the submenu.

```tsx
import { Menu } from '@ark-ui/solid/menu'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const Nested = () => (
  <Menu.Root>
    <Menu.Trigger>Open menu</Menu.Trigger>
    <Portal>
      <Menu.Positioner>
        <Menu.Content>
          <Menu.Root>
            <Menu.TriggerItem>JS Frameworks</Menu.TriggerItem>
            <Portal>
              <Menu.Positioner>
                <Menu.Content>
                  <Menu.Item value="react">React</Menu.Item>
                  <Menu.Item value="solid">Solid</Menu.Item>
                  <Menu.Item value="vue">Vue</Menu.Item>
                </Menu.Content>
              </Menu.Positioner>
            </Portal>
          </Menu.Root>
          <Menu.Root>
            <Menu.TriggerItem>CSS Frameworks</Menu.TriggerItem>
            <Portal>
              <Menu.Positioner>
                <Menu.Content>
                  <Menu.Item value="panda">Panda</Menu.Item>
                  <Menu.Item value="tailwind">Tailwind</Menu.Item>
                </Menu.Content>
              </Menu.Positioner>
            </Portal>
          </Menu.Root>
        </Menu.Content>
      </Menu.Positioner>
    </Portal>
  </Menu.Root>
)
```

### Checkbox

To add a checkbox to a menu item, use the `Menu.Checkbox` component.

```tsx
import { Menu } from '@ark-ui/solid/menu'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'

export const Checkbox = () => {
  const [checked, setChecked] = createSignal(true)

  return (
    <Menu.Root>
      <Menu.Trigger>Open menu</Menu.Trigger>
      <Menu.Positioner>
        <Menu.Content>
          <Menu.CheckboxItem checked={checked()} onCheckedChange={setChecked} value="checked">
            <Menu.ItemIndicator>✅</Menu.ItemIndicator>
            <Menu.ItemText>Check me</Menu.ItemText>
          </Menu.CheckboxItem>
        </Menu.Content>
      </Menu.Positioner>
    </Menu.Root>
  )
}
```

### Radio Group

To group radio option items, use the `Menu.RadioGroup` component.

```tsx
import { Menu } from '@ark-ui/solid/menu'
import { Index, createSignal } from 'solid-js'

export const RadioGroup = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = createSignal('React')

  return (
    <Menu.Root>
      <Menu.Trigger>Open menu</Menu.Trigger>
      <Menu.Positioner>
        <Menu.Content>
          <Menu.RadioItemGroup value={value()} onValueChange={(e) => setValue(e.value)}>
            <Menu.ItemGroupLabel>JS Frameworks</Menu.ItemGroupLabel>
            <Index each={['React', 'Solid', 'Svelte', 'Vue']}>
              {(framework) => (
                <Menu.RadioItem value={framework()} disabled={framework() === 'Svelte'}>
                  <Menu.ItemIndicator>✅</Menu.ItemIndicator>
                  <Menu.ItemText>{framework()}</Menu.ItemText>
                </Menu.RadioItem>
              )}
            </Index>
          </Menu.RadioItemGroup>
        </Menu.Content>
      </Menu.Positioner>
    </Menu.Root>
  )
}
```

### Using the Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the menu. It accepts the value of the `useMenu` hook. You can
leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the menu.

```tsx
import { Menu, useMenu } from '@ark-ui/solid/menu'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const menu = useMenu()

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => menu.api().setHighlightedValue('solid')}>Highlight Solid</button>

      <Menu.Root>
        <Menu.Trigger>
          Open menu <Menu.Indicator>➡️</Menu.Indicator>
        </Menu.Trigger>
        <Menu.Positioner>
          <Menu.Content>
            <Menu.Item value="react">React</Menu.Item>
            <Menu.Item value="solid">Solid</Menu.Item>
            <Menu.Item value="vue">Vue</Menu.Item>
            <Menu.Item value="svelte">Svelte</Menu.Item>
          </Menu.Content>
        </Menu.Positioner>
      </Menu.Root>
    </>
  )
}
```

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

# Number Input



## Anatomy

To set up the number input correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



## Examples

Learn how to use the `NumberInput` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

```tsx
import { NumberInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/number-input'

export const Basic = () => (
  <NumberInput.Root>
    <NumberInput.Label>Label</NumberInput.Label>
    <NumberInput.Input />
    <NumberInput.Control>
      <NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>-1</NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>
      <NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>+1</NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>
    </NumberInput.Control>
  </NumberInput.Root>
)
```

### Setting a minimum and maximum value

Pass the `min` prop or `max` prop to set an upper and lower limit for the input. By default, the input will restrict the
value to stay within the specified range.

```tsx
import { NumberInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/number-input'

export const MinMax = () => (
  <NumberInput.Root min={0} max={10}>
    <NumberInput.Scrubber />
    <NumberInput.Label>Label</NumberInput.Label>
    <NumberInput.Input />
    <NumberInput.Control>
      <NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>-1</NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>
      <NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>+1</NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>
    </NumberInput.Control>
  </NumberInput.Root>
)
```
### Adjusting the precision of the value

In some cases, you might need the value to be rounded to specific decimal points. Set the `formatOptions` and provide
`Intl.NumberFormatOptions` such as `maximumFractionDigits` or `minimumFractionDigits`.

```tsx
import { NumberInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/number-input'

export const FractionDigits = () => (
  <NumberInput.Root formatOptions={{ minimumFractionDigits: 2, maximumFractionDigits: 4 }} value="1.00">
    <NumberInput.Scrubber />
    <NumberInput.Label>Label</NumberInput.Label>
    <NumberInput.Input />
    <NumberInput.Control>
      <NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>-1</NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>
      <NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>+1</NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>
    </NumberInput.Control>
  </NumberInput.Root>
)
```

### Scrubbing the input value

The NumberInput supports the scrubber interaction pattern. To use this pattern, render the `NumberInput.Scrubber`
component. It uses the Pointer lock API and tracks the pointer movement. It also renders a virtual cursor which mimics
the real cursor's pointer.

```tsx
import { NumberInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/number-input'

export const Scrubber = () => (
  <NumberInput.Root>
    <NumberInput.Scrubber />
    <NumberInput.Label>Label</NumberInput.Label>
    <NumberInput.Input />
    <NumberInput.Control>
      <NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>-1</NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>
      <NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>+1</NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>
    </NumberInput.Control>
  </NumberInput.Root>
)
```

### Using the mouse wheel to change value

The NumberInput exposes a way to increment/decrement the value using the mouse wheel event. To activate this, set the
`allowMouseWheel` prop to `true`.

```tsx
import { NumberInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/number-input'

export const MouseWheel = () => (
  <NumberInput.Root allowMouseWheel>
    <NumberInput.Scrubber />
    <NumberInput.Label>Label</NumberInput.Label>
    <NumberInput.Input />
    <NumberInput.Control>
      <NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>-1</NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>
      <NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>+1</NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>
    </NumberInput.Control>
  </NumberInput.Root>
)
```

### Clamp value when user blurs the input

In most cases, users can type custom values in the input field. If the typed value is greater than the max, the value is
reset to max when the user blur out of the input.

To disable this behavior, pass `clampValueOnBlur` and set to `false`.

```tsx
import { NumberInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/number-input'

export const NoClamp = () => (
  <NumberInput.Root clampValueOnBlur={false}>
    <NumberInput.Scrubber />
    <NumberInput.Label>Label</NumberInput.Label>
    <NumberInput.Input />
    <NumberInput.Control>
      <NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>-1</NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>
      <NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>+1</NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>
    </NumberInput.Control>
  </NumberInput.Root>
)
```

### Usage within forms

To use the number input within forms, set the `name` prop.

```tsx
import { NumberInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/number-input'

export const FormUsage = () => (
  <NumberInput.Root name="quantity">
    <NumberInput.Scrubber />
    <NumberInput.Label>Label</NumberInput.Label>
    <NumberInput.Input />
    <NumberInput.Control>
      <NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>-1</NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>
      <NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>+1</NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>
    </NumberInput.Control>
  </NumberInput.Root>
)
```

### Format and parse value

To apply custom formatting to the input's value, set the `formatOptions` and provide `Intl.NumberFormatOptions` such as
`style` and `currency`.

```tsx
import { NumberInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/number-input'

export const Formatted = () => (
  <NumberInput.Root
    formatOptions={{
      style: 'currency',
      currency: 'USD',
    }}
  >
    <NumberInput.Scrubber />
    <NumberInput.Label>Label</NumberInput.Label>
    <NumberInput.Input />
    <NumberInput.Control>
      <NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>-1</NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>
      <NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>+1</NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>
    </NumberInput.Control>
  </NumberInput.Root>
)
```

### Using the Field Component

The `Field` component helps manage form-related state and accessibility attributes of a number input. It includes
handling ARIA labels, helper text, and error text to ensure proper accessibility.

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'
import { NumberInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/number-input'

export const WithField = (props: Field.RootProps) => (
  <Field.Root {...props}>
    <NumberInput.Root>
      <NumberInput.Label>Label</NumberInput.Label>
      <NumberInput.Input />
      <NumberInput.Control>
        <NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>-1</NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>
        <NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>+1</NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>
      </NumberInput.Control>
    </NumberInput.Root>
    <Field.HelperText>Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
)
```

### Using the Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the number-input. It accepts the value of the `useNumber-input`
hook. You can leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the number-input.

```tsx
import { NumberInput, useNumberInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/number-input'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const numberInput = useNumberInput()

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => numberInput().focus()}>Focus</button>

      <NumberInput.RootProvider value={numberInput}>
        <NumberInput.Label>Label</NumberInput.Label>
        <NumberInput.Input />
        <NumberInput.Control>
          <NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>-1</NumberInput.DecrementTrigger>
          <NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>+1</NumberInput.IncrementTrigger>
        </NumberInput.Control>
      </NumberInput.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

## Guides

### Using the Scrubber

The `NumberInput.Scrubber` component provides an interactive scrub area that allows users to drag to change the input
value. It renders as a `<div>` element and displays a custom cursor element during scrubbing interactions.

This component utilizes the [Pointer Lock API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_Lock_API) for
smooth dragging interactions.

> **Note:** Browsers may show a notification when the Pointer Lock API is activated. The scrubber is automatically
> disabled in Safari to prevent layout shifts.

### Controlling the value

When controlling the NumberInput component, it's recommended to use string values instead of converting to numbers. This
is especially important when using `formatOptions` for currency or locale-specific formatting.

```tsx
const [value, setValue] = useState('0')

<NumberInput.Root value={value} onValueChange={(details) => setValue(details.value)}>
  {/* ... */}
</NumberInput.Root>
```

Converting values to numbers can cause issues with locale-specific formatting, particularly for currencies that use
different decimal and thousands separators (e.g., `1.523,30` vs `1,523.30`). By keeping values as strings, you preserve
the correct formatting and avoid parsing issues.

If you need to submit a numeric value in your form, use a hidden input that reads `valueAsNumber` from
`NumberInput.Context`:

```tsx
<NumberInput.Root value={value} onValueChange={(details) => setValue(details.value)}>
  <NumberInput.Input />
  <NumberInput.Context>
    {(context) => <input type="hidden" name="amount" value={context.valueAsNumber} />}
  </NumberInput.Context>
</NumberInput.Root>
```

# Pagination



## Anatomy

To set up the pagination correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



## Examples

Learn how to use the `Pagination` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

```tsx
import { Pagination } from '@ark-ui/solid/pagination'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

export const Basic = () => (
  <Pagination.Root count={5000} pageSize={10} siblingCount={2}>
    <Pagination.PrevTrigger>Previous Page</Pagination.PrevTrigger>
    <Pagination.Context>
      {(api) => (
        <For each={api().pages}>
          {(page, index) =>
            page.type === 'page' ? (
              <Pagination.Item {...page}>{page.value}</Pagination.Item>
            ) : (
              <Pagination.Ellipsis index={index()}>&#8230;</Pagination.Ellipsis>
            )
          }
        </For>
      )}
    </Pagination.Context>
    <Pagination.NextTrigger>Next Page</Pagination.NextTrigger>
  </Pagination.Root>
)
```

### Controlled Pagination

To create a controlled Pagination component, manage the state of the current page using the `page` prop and update it
when the `onPageChange` event handler is called:

```tsx
import { Pagination } from '@ark-ui/solid/pagination'
import { For, createSignal } from 'solid-js'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = createSignal(1)

  return (
    <Pagination.Root
      count={5000}
      pageSize={10}
      siblingCount={2}
      page={currentPage()}
      onPageChange={(details) => setCurrentPage(details.page)}
    >
      <Pagination.PrevTrigger>Previous Page</Pagination.PrevTrigger>
      <Pagination.Context>
        {(api) => (
          <For each={api().pages}>
            {(page, index) =>
              page.type === 'page' ? (
                <Pagination.Item {...page}>{page.value}</Pagination.Item>
              ) : (
                <Pagination.Ellipsis index={index()}>&#8230;</Pagination.Ellipsis>
              )
            }
          </For>
        )}
      </Pagination.Context>
      <Pagination.NextTrigger>Next Page</Pagination.NextTrigger>
    </Pagination.Root>
  )
}
```

### Customizing Pagination

You can customize the Pagination component by setting various props such as `dir`, `pageSize`, `siblingCount`, and
`translations`. Here's an example of a customized Pagination:

```tsx
import { Pagination } from '@ark-ui/solid/pagination'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

export const Customized = () => {
  return (
    <Pagination.Root
      count={5000}
      pageSize={20}
      siblingCount={3}
      translations={{
        nextTriggerLabel: 'Next',
        prevTriggerLabel: 'Prev',
        itemLabel: (details) => `Page ${details.page}`,
      }}
    >
      <Pagination.PrevTrigger>Previous Page</Pagination.PrevTrigger>
      <Pagination.Context>
        {(api) => (
          <For each={api().pages}>
            {(page, index) =>
              page.type === 'page' ? (
                <Pagination.Item {...page}>{page.value}</Pagination.Item>
              ) : (
                <Pagination.Ellipsis index={index()}>&#8230;</Pagination.Ellipsis>
              )
            }
          </For>
        )}
      </Pagination.Context>
      <Pagination.NextTrigger>Next Page</Pagination.NextTrigger>
    </Pagination.Root>
  )
}
```

### Using Context

The `Context` component provides access to the pagination state and methods through a render prop pattern. This allows
you to access methods like `setPage`, `setPageSize`, `goToNextPage`, `goToPrevPage`, `goToFirstPage`, `goToLastPage`, as
well as properties like `totalPages` and `pageRange`.

```tsx
import { Pagination } from '@ark-ui/solid/pagination'

export const Context = () => {
  return (
    <Pagination.Root count={100} pageSize={10}>
      <Pagination.Context>
        {(api) => (
          <div>
            <button onClick={() => api().goToFirstPage()}>First</button>
            <button onClick={() => api().goToPrevPage()}>Previous</button>
            <button onClick={() => api().setPage(5)}>Go to Page 5</button>
            <button onClick={() => api().goToNextPage()}>Next</button>
            <button onClick={() => api().goToLastPage()}>Last</button>

            <p>
              Page {api().page} of {api().totalPages}
            </p>
            <p>
              Items {api().pageRange.start + 1}-{api().pageRange.end}
            </p>

            <button onClick={() => api().setPageSize(20)}>20 per page</button>
          </div>
        )}
      </Pagination.Context>
    </Pagination.Root>
  )
}
```

### Data Slicing

Use the `slice()` method to paginate actual data arrays. This method automatically slices your data based on the current
page and page size.

```tsx
import { Pagination } from '@ark-ui/solid/pagination'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

const items = Array.from({ length: 100 }, (_, i) => `Item ${i + 1}`)

export const DataSlicing = () => {
  return (
    <Pagination.Root count={items.length} pageSize={10}>
      <Pagination.Context>
        {(api) => (
          <div>
            <div>
              <h3>Current Page Items:</h3>
              <ul>
                <For each={api().slice(items)}>{(item) => <li>{item}</li>}</For>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
              <Pagination.PrevTrigger>Previous</Pagination.PrevTrigger>

              <For each={api().pages}>
                {(page, index) =>
                  page.type === 'page' ? (
                    <Pagination.Item {...page}>{page.value}</Pagination.Item>
                  ) : (
                    <Pagination.Ellipsis index={index()}>&#8230;</Pagination.Ellipsis>
                  )
                }
              </For>

              <Pagination.NextTrigger>Next</Pagination.NextTrigger>
            </div>
          </div>
        )}
      </Pagination.Context>
    </Pagination.Root>
  )
}
```

### Page Range Display

Display the current page range information using the `pageRange` property. This shows which items are currently visible
(e.g., "Showing 1-10 of 100 results").

```tsx
import { Pagination } from '@ark-ui/solid/pagination'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

export const PageRange = () => {
  return (
    <Pagination.Root count={100} pageSize={10}>
      <Pagination.Context>
        {(api) => (
          <div>
            <div>
              <Pagination.PrevTrigger>Previous</Pagination.PrevTrigger>

              <For each={api().pages}>
                {(page, index) =>
                  page.type === 'page' ? (
                    <Pagination.Item {...page}>{page.value}</Pagination.Item>
                  ) : (
                    <Pagination.Ellipsis index={index()}>&#8230;</Pagination.Ellipsis>
                  )
                }
              </For>

              <Pagination.NextTrigger>Next</Pagination.NextTrigger>
            </div>

            <div>
              <p>
                Showing {api().pageRange.start + 1}-{api().pageRange.end} of {api().count} results
              </p>
              <p>
                Page {api().page} of {api().totalPages}
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
        )}
      </Pagination.Context>
    </Pagination.Root>
  )
}
```

### Page Size Control

Control the number of items per page dynamically using `setPageSize()`. This example shows how to integrate a native
select element to change the page size.

```tsx
import { Pagination } from '@ark-ui/solid/pagination'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

export const PageSizeControl = () => {
  return (
    <Pagination.Root count={100} pageSize={10}>
      <Pagination.Context>
        {(api) => (
          <div>
            <div>
              <label>Items per page: </label>
              <select value={api().pageSize} onChange={(e) => api().setPageSize(Number(e.target.value))}>
                <option value={5}>5</option>
                <option value={10}>10</option>
                <option value={20}>20</option>
                <option value={50}>50</option>
              </select>
            </div>

            <div>
              <Pagination.PrevTrigger>Previous</Pagination.PrevTrigger>

              <For each={api().pages}>
                {(page, index) =>
                  page.type === 'page' ? (
                    <Pagination.Item {...page}>{page.value}</Pagination.Item>
                  ) : (
                    <Pagination.Ellipsis index={index()}>&#8230;</Pagination.Ellipsis>
                  )
                }
              </For>

              <Pagination.NextTrigger>Next</Pagination.NextTrigger>
            </div>

            <p>
              Page {api().page} of {api().totalPages}
            </p>
          </div>
        )}
      </Pagination.Context>
    </Pagination.Root>
  )
}
```

### Link Pagination

Create pagination with link navigation for better SEO and accessibility. This example shows how to use the pagination
component with anchor links instead of buttons.

```tsx
import { Pagination, usePagination } from '@ark-ui/solid/pagination'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

export const Link = () => {
  const pagination = usePagination({
    type: 'link',
    count: 100,
    pageSize: 10,
    siblingCount: 2,
    getPageUrl: ({ page }) => `/page=${page}`,
  })

  return (
    <Pagination.RootProvider value={pagination}>
      <a {...pagination().getPrevTriggerProps()}>Previous</a>
      <For each={pagination().pages}>
        {(page, index) =>
          page.type === 'page' ? (
            <a {...pagination().getItemProps(page)}>{page.value}</a>
          ) : (
            <span {...pagination().getEllipsisProps({ index: index() })}>&#8230;</span>
          )
        }
      </For>
      <a {...pagination().getNextTriggerProps()}>Next</a>
    </Pagination.RootProvider>
  )
}
```

### Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the pagination. It accepts the value of the `usePagination` hook.
You can leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the pagination.

```tsx
import { Pagination, usePagination } from '@ark-ui/solid/pagination'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const pagination = usePagination({ count: 5000, pageSize: 10, siblingCount: 2 })

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => pagination().goToNextPage()}>Next Page</button>

      <Pagination.RootProvider value={pagination}>
        <Pagination.PrevTrigger>Previous Page</Pagination.PrevTrigger>
        <Pagination.Context>
          {(api) => (
            <For each={api().pages}>
              {(page, index) =>
                page.type === 'page' ? (
                  <Pagination.Item {...page}>{page.value}</Pagination.Item>
                ) : (
                  <Pagination.Ellipsis index={index()}>&#8230;</Pagination.Ellipsis>
                )
              }
            </For>
          )}
        </Pagination.Context>
        <Pagination.NextTrigger>Next Page</Pagination.NextTrigger>
      </Pagination.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

# Password Input



## Anatomy

To set up the password input correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



## Examples

Learn how to use the `PasswordInput` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

```tsx
import { PasswordInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/password-input'
import { EyeIcon, EyeOffIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

export const Basic = () => (
  <PasswordInput.Root>
    <PasswordInput.Label>Password</PasswordInput.Label>
    <PasswordInput.Control>
      <PasswordInput.Input />
      <PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger>
        <PasswordInput.Indicator fallback={<EyeOffIcon />}>
          <EyeIcon />
        </PasswordInput.Indicator>
      </PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger>
    </PasswordInput.Control>
  </PasswordInput.Root>
)
```

### Autocomplete

Use the `autoComplete` prop to manage autocompletion in the input.

- `new-password` — The user is creating a new password.
- `current-password` — The user is entering an existing password.

```tsx
import { PasswordInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/password-input'
import { EyeIcon, EyeOffIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

export const Autocomplete = () => (
  <PasswordInput.Root autoComplete="new-password">
    <PasswordInput.Label>Password</PasswordInput.Label>
    <PasswordInput.Control>
      <PasswordInput.Input />
      <PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger>
        <PasswordInput.Indicator fallback={<EyeOffIcon />}>
          <EyeIcon />
        </PasswordInput.Indicator>
      </PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger>
    </PasswordInput.Control>
  </PasswordInput.Root>
)
```

### Root Provider

Use the `usePasswordInput` hook to create the password input store and pass it to the `PasswordInput.RootProvider`
component. This allows you to have maximum control over the password input programmatically.

```tsx
import { PasswordInput, usePasswordInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/password-input'
import { EyeIcon, EyeOffIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const passwordInput = usePasswordInput()

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => passwordInput().focus()}>Focus</button>
      <button onClick={() => passwordInput().setVisible(!passwordInput().visible)}>
        {passwordInput().visible ? 'Hide' : 'Show'} Password
      </button>

      <PasswordInput.RootProvider value={passwordInput}>
        <PasswordInput.Label>Password</PasswordInput.Label>
        <PasswordInput.Control>
          <PasswordInput.Input />
          <PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger>
            <PasswordInput.Indicator fallback={<EyeOffIcon />}>
              <EyeIcon />
            </PasswordInput.Indicator>
          </PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger>
        </PasswordInput.Control>
      </PasswordInput.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Field

Here's an example of how to use the `PasswordInput` component with the `Field` component.

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'
import { PasswordInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/password-input'
import { EyeIcon, EyeOffIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

export const WithField = () => (
  <Field.Root>
    <PasswordInput.Root>
      <PasswordInput.Label>Password</PasswordInput.Label>
      <PasswordInput.Control>
        <PasswordInput.Input />
        <PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger>
          <PasswordInput.Indicator fallback={<EyeOffIcon />}>
            <EyeIcon />
          </PasswordInput.Indicator>
        </PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger>
      </PasswordInput.Control>
    </PasswordInput.Root>
    <Field.HelperText>Enter your password</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText>Password is required</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
)
```

### Ignoring password managers

Use the `ignorePasswordManager` prop to ignore password managers like 1Password, LastPass, etc. This is useful for
non-login scenarios (e.g., "api keys", "secure notes", "temporary passwords")

> **Currently, this only works for 1Password, LastPass, Bitwarden, Dashlane, and Proton Pass.**

```tsx
import { PasswordInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/password-input'
import { EyeIcon, EyeOffIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

export const IgnorePasswordManager = () => (
  <PasswordInput.Root ignorePasswordManagers>
    <PasswordInput.Label>API Key</PasswordInput.Label>
    <PasswordInput.Control>
      <PasswordInput.Input value="spd_1234567890" />
      <PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger>
        <PasswordInput.Indicator fallback={<EyeOffIcon />}>
          <EyeIcon />
        </PasswordInput.Indicator>
      </PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger>
    </PasswordInput.Control>
  </PasswordInput.Root>
)
```

### Controlled visibility

Use the `visible` and `onVisibilityChange` props to control the visibility of the password input.

```tsx
import { PasswordInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/password-input'
import { EyeIcon, EyeOffIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'

export const ControlledVisibility = () => {
  const [visible, setVisible] = createSignal(false)
  return (
    <PasswordInput.Root visible={visible()} onVisibilityChange={(e) => setVisible(e.visible)}>
      <PasswordInput.Label>Password is {visible() ? 'visible' : 'hidden'}</PasswordInput.Label>
      <PasswordInput.Control>
        <PasswordInput.Input />
        <PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger>
          <PasswordInput.Indicator fallback={<EyeOffIcon />}>
            <EyeIcon />
          </PasswordInput.Indicator>
        </PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger>
      </PasswordInput.Control>
    </PasswordInput.Root>
  )
}
```

### Strength meter

Combine the `PasswordInput` with a password strength library to show visual feedback about password strength. This
example uses the [`check-password-strength`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/check-password-strength) package to provide
real-time strength validation.

```tsx
import { PasswordInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/password-input'
import { passwordStrength, type Options } from 'check-password-strength'
import { EyeIcon, EyeOffIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { createMemo, createSignal, Show } from 'solid-js'

const strengthOptions: Options<string> = [
  { id: 0, value: 'weak', minDiversity: 0, minLength: 0 },
  { id: 1, value: 'medium', minDiversity: 2, minLength: 6 },
  { id: 2, value: 'strong', minDiversity: 4, minLength: 8 },
]

const strengthMap = new Map([
  ['weak', { color: 'red', width: '30%' }],
  ['medium', { color: 'orange', width: '60%' }],
  ['strong', { color: 'green', width: '100%' }],
])

export const StrengthMeter = () => {
  const [password, setPassword] = createSignal('')

  const strength = createMemo(() => {
    if (!password()) return null
    const { value } = passwordStrength(password(), strengthOptions)
    const data = strengthMap.get(value)
    return data ? { value, ...data } : null
  })

  return (
    <PasswordInput.Root style={{ 'max-width': '400px' }}>
      <PasswordInput.Label>Password</PasswordInput.Label>
      <PasswordInput.Control>
        <PasswordInput.Input
          value={password()}
          onInput={(e) => setPassword(e.currentTarget.value)}
          placeholder="Enter your password"
        />
        <PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger>
          <PasswordInput.Indicator fallback={<EyeOffIcon />}>
            <EyeIcon />
          </PasswordInput.Indicator>
        </PasswordInput.VisibilityTrigger>
      </PasswordInput.Control>
      <Show when={strength()}>
        {(value) => (
          <div style={{ 'margin-top': '8px' }}>
            <div role="progressbar" style={{ height: '8px', border: '1px solid lightgray' }}>
              <div style={{ height: '100%', background: value().color, width: value().width }} role="presentation" />
            </div>
            <div style={{ 'margin-top': '4px', 'font-size': '12px', 'text-transform': 'capitalize' }}>
              {value().value} password
            </div>
          </div>
        )}
      </Show>
    </PasswordInput.Root>
  )
}
```

# Pin Input



## Anatomy

To set up the pin input correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



## Examples

Learn how to use the `PinInput` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

```tsx
import { PinInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/pin-input'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const Basic = () => (
  <PinInput.Root onValueComplete={(e) => alert(e.valueAsString)}>
    <PinInput.Label>Label</PinInput.Label>
    <PinInput.Control>
      <Index each={[0, 1, 2]}>{(id) => <PinInput.Input index={id()} />}</Index>
    </PinInput.Control>
    <PinInput.HiddenInput />
  </PinInput.Root>
)
```

### Setting a default value

To set the initial value of the pin input, set the `defaultValue` prop.

```tsx
import { PinInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/pin-input'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const InitialValue = () => (
  <PinInput.Root value={['1', '2', '3']}>
    <PinInput.Label>Label</PinInput.Label>
    <PinInput.Control>
      <Index each={[0, 1, 2]}>{(id) => <PinInput.Input index={id()} />}</Index>
    </PinInput.Control>
    <PinInput.HiddenInput />
  </PinInput.Root>
)
```

### Changing the placeholder

To customize the default pin input placeholder `○` for each input, pass the placeholder prop and set it to your desired
value.

```tsx
import { PinInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/pin-input'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const Customized = () => (
  <PinInput.Root placeholder="*">
    <PinInput.Label>Label</PinInput.Label>
    <PinInput.Control>
      <Index each={[0, 1, 2]}>{(id) => <PinInput.Input index={id()} />}</Index>
    </PinInput.Control>
    <PinInput.HiddenInput />
  </PinInput.Root>
)
```

### Blur on complete

By default, the last input maintains focus when filled, and we invoke the `onValueComplete` callback. To blur the last
input when the user completes the input, set the prop `blurOnComplete` to `true`.

```tsx
import { PinInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/pin-input'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const Blurred = () => (
  <PinInput.Root blurOnComplete>
    <PinInput.Label>Label</PinInput.Label>
    <PinInput.Control>
      <Index each={[0, 1, 2]}>{(id) => <PinInput.Input index={id()} />}</Index>
    </PinInput.Control>
    <PinInput.HiddenInput />
  </PinInput.Root>
)
```

### Using OTP mode

To trigger smartphone OTP auto-suggestion, it is recommended to set the `autocomplete` attribute to "one-time-code". The
pin input component provides support for this automatically when you set the `otp` prop to true.

```tsx
import { PinInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/pin-input'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const OTPMode = () => (
  <PinInput.Root otp>
    <PinInput.Label>Label</PinInput.Label>
    <PinInput.Control>
      <Index each={[0, 1, 2]}>{(id) => <PinInput.Input index={id()} />}</Index>
    </PinInput.Control>
    <PinInput.HiddenInput />
  </PinInput.Root>
)
```

### Securing the text input

When collecting private or sensitive information using the pin input, you might need to mask the value entered, similar
to `<input type="password"/>`. Pass the `mask` prop to `true`.

```tsx
import { PinInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/pin-input'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const WithMask = () => (
  <PinInput.Root mask>
    <PinInput.Label>Label</PinInput.Label>
    <PinInput.Control>
      <Index each={[0, 1, 2]}>{(id) => <PinInput.Input index={id()} />}</Index>
    </PinInput.Control>
    <PinInput.HiddenInput />
  </PinInput.Root>
)
```

### Listening for changes

The pin input component invokes several callback functions when the user enters:

- `onValueChange` — Callback invoked when the value is changed.
- `onValueComplete` — Callback invoked when all fields have been completed (by typing or pasting).
- `onValueInvalid` — Callback invoked when an invalid value is entered into the input. An invalid value is any value
  that doesn't match the specified "type".

### Using the Field Component

The `Field` component helps manage form-related state and accessibility attributes of a pin input. It includes handling
ARIA labels, helper text, and error text to ensure proper accessibility.

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'
import { PinInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/pin-input'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const WithField = (props: Field.RootProps) => (
  <Field.Root {...props}>
    <PinInput.Root>
      <PinInput.Label>Label</PinInput.Label>
      <PinInput.Control>
        <Index each={[0, 1, 2]}>{(id) => <PinInput.Input index={id()} />}</Index>
      </PinInput.Control>
      <PinInput.HiddenInput />
    </PinInput.Root>
    <Field.HelperText>Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
)
```

### Using the Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the pin-input. It accepts the value of the `usePin-input` hook. You
can leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the pin-input.

```tsx
import { PinInput, usePinInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/pin-input'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const pinInput = usePinInput({ onValueComplete: (e) => alert(e.valueAsString) })

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => pinInput().focus()}>Focus</button>

      <PinInput.RootProvider value={pinInput}>
        <PinInput.Label>Label</PinInput.Label>
        <PinInput.Control>
          <Index each={[0, 1, 2]}>{(id) => <PinInput.Input index={id()} />}</Index>
        </PinInput.Control>
        <PinInput.HiddenInput />
      </PinInput.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

# Popover



## Anatomy

To set up the popover correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



## Examples

Learn how to use the `Popover` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

```tsx
import { Popover } from '@ark-ui/solid/popover'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

export const Basic = () => (
  <Popover.Root>
    <Popover.Trigger>
      Click Me
      <Popover.Indicator>
        <ChevronRightIcon />
      </Popover.Indicator>
    </Popover.Trigger>
    <Popover.Positioner>
      <Popover.Content>
        <Popover.Title>Title</Popover.Title>
        <Popover.Description>Description</Popover.Description>
      </Popover.Content>
    </Popover.Positioner>
  </Popover.Root>
)
```

### Using a Portal

By default, the popover is rendered in the same DOM hierarchy as the trigger. To render the popover within a portal, set
the `portalled` prop to `true`.

> Note: This requires that you render the component within a `Portal` based on the framework you use.

```tsx
import { Popover } from '@ark-ui/solid/popover'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const Portalled = () => (
  <Popover.Root portalled>
    <Popover.Trigger>
      Click Me
      <Popover.Indicator>
        <ChevronRightIcon />
      </Popover.Indicator>
    </Popover.Trigger>
    <Portal>
      <Popover.Positioner>
        <Popover.Content>
          <Popover.Title>Title</Popover.Title>
          <Popover.Description>Description</Popover.Description>
        </Popover.Content>
      </Popover.Positioner>
    </Portal>
  </Popover.Root>
)
```

### Adding an arrow

To render an arrow within the popover, render the component `Popover.Arrow` and `Popover.ArrowTip` as children of
`Popover.Positioner`.

```tsx
import { Popover } from '@ark-ui/solid/popover'

export const Arrow = () => (
  <Popover.Root>
    <Popover.Trigger>Click Me</Popover.Trigger>
    <Popover.Positioner>
      <Popover.Content>
        <Popover.Arrow>
          <Popover.ArrowTip />
        </Popover.Arrow>
        <Popover.Title>Title</Popover.Title>
        <Popover.Description>Description</Popover.Description>
        <Popover.CloseTrigger>Close</Popover.CloseTrigger>
      </Popover.Content>
    </Popover.Positioner>
  </Popover.Root>
)
```

### Listening for open and close events

When the popover is opened or closed, we invoke the `onOpenChange` callback.

```tsx
import { Popover } from '@ark-ui/solid/popover'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

export const OnOpenChange = () => {
  return (
    <Popover.Root onOpenChange={(open) => alert(open ? 'opened' : 'closed')}>
      <Popover.Trigger>
        Click Me
        <Popover.Indicator>
          <ChevronRightIcon />
        </Popover.Indicator>
      </Popover.Trigger>
      <Popover.Positioner>
        <Popover.Content>
          <Popover.Title>Title</Popover.Title>
          <Popover.Description>Description</Popover.Description>
        </Popover.Content>
      </Popover.Positioner>
    </Popover.Root>
  )
}
```

### Control the open state

Use the `isOpen` prop to control the open state of the popover.

```tsx
import { Popover } from '@ark-ui/solid/popover'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = createSignal(false)
  return (
    <>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => setIsOpen(!isOpen())}>
        Toggle
      </button>
      <Popover.Root open={isOpen()}>
        <Popover.Anchor>Anchor</Popover.Anchor>
        <Popover.Positioner>
          <Popover.Content>
            <Popover.Title>Title</Popover.Title>
            <Popover.Description>Description</Popover.Description>
            <Popover.CloseTrigger>Close</Popover.CloseTrigger>
          </Popover.Content>
        </Popover.Positioner>
      </Popover.Root>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Modifying the close behavior

The popover is designed to close on blur and when the <kbd>esc</kbd> key is pressed.

To prevent it from closing on blur (clicking or focusing outside), pass the `closeOnInteractOutside` prop and set it to
`false`.

To prevent it from closing when the <kbd>esc</kbd> key is pressed, pass the `closeOnEsc` prop and set it to `false`.

```tsx
import { Popover } from '@ark-ui/solid/popover'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const CloseBehavior = () => (
  <Popover.Root closeOnEscape={false} closeOnInteractOutside={false}>
    <Popover.Trigger>Click Me</Popover.Trigger>
    <Portal>
      <Popover.Positioner>
        <Popover.Content>
          <Popover.Title>Title</Popover.Title>
          <Popover.Description>Description</Popover.Description>
          <Popover.CloseTrigger>Close</Popover.CloseTrigger>
        </Popover.Content>
      </Popover.Positioner>
    </Portal>
  </Popover.Root>
)
```

### Changing the placement

To change the placement of the popover, set the `positioning` prop.

```tsx
import { Popover } from '@ark-ui/solid/popover'

export const Positioning = () => (
  <Popover.Root
    positioning={{
      placement: 'left-start',
      offset: { mainAxis: 12, crossAxis: 12 },
    }}
  >
    <Popover.Trigger>Click Me</Popover.Trigger>
    <Popover.Positioner>
      <Popover.Content>
        <Popover.Title>Title</Popover.Title>
        <Popover.Description>Description</Popover.Description>
        <Popover.CloseTrigger>Close</Popover.CloseTrigger>
      </Popover.Content>
    </Popover.Positioner>
  </Popover.Root>
)
```

### Changing the modality

In some cases, you might want the popover to be modal. This means that it'll:

- trap focus within its content
- block scrolling on the body
- disable pointer interactions outside the popover
- hide content behind the popover from screen readers

To make the popover modal, set the `modal` prop to `true`. When `modal={true}`, we set the `portalled` attribute to
`true` as well.

```tsx
import { Popover } from '@ark-ui/solid/popover'

export const Modal = () => (
  <Popover.Root modal>
    <Popover.Trigger>Click Me</Popover.Trigger>
    <Popover.Positioner>
      <Popover.Content>
        <Popover.Title>Title</Popover.Title>
        <Popover.Description>Description</Popover.Description>
        <Popover.CloseTrigger>Close</Popover.CloseTrigger>
      </Popover.Content>
    </Popover.Positioner>
  </Popover.Root>
)
```

### Using the Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the popover. It accepts the value of the `usePopover` hook. You can
leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the popover.

```tsx
import { Popover, usePopover } from '@ark-ui/solid/popover'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const popover = usePopover()

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => popover().setOpen(true)}>Popover is {popover().open ? 'open' : 'closed'}</button>

      <Popover.RootProvider value={popover}>
        <Popover.Trigger>
          Click Me
          <Popover.Indicator>
            <ChevronRightIcon />
          </Popover.Indicator>
        </Popover.Trigger>
        <Popover.Positioner>
          <Popover.Content>
            <Popover.Title>Title</Popover.Title>
            <Popover.Description>Description</Popover.Description>
          </Popover.Content>
        </Popover.Positioner>
      </Popover.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

## Guides

### Available height and width

The following css variables are exposed to the `Popover.Positioner` which you can use to style the `Popover.Content`

```css
/* width of the popover trigger */
--reference-width: <pixel-value>;
/* width of the available viewport */
--available-width: <pixel-value>;
/* height of the available viewport */
--available-height: <pixel-value>;
```

# Progress - Circular



## Anatomy

To set up the progress correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



## Examples

Learn how to use the `Progress` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

```tsx
import { Progress } from '@ark-ui/solid/progress'

export const Basic = () => (
  <Progress.Root defaultValue={42}>
    <Progress.Label>Label</Progress.Label>
    <Progress.ValueText />
    <Progress.Circle>
      <Progress.CircleTrack />
      <Progress.CircleRange />
    </Progress.Circle>
  </Progress.Root>
)
```

### Set a min and max value

By default, the maximum is `100`. If that's not what you want, you can easily specify a different bound by changing the
value of the `max` prop. You can do the same with the minimum value by setting the `min` prop.

For example, to show the user a progress from `10` to `30`, you can use:

```tsx
import { Progress } from '@ark-ui/solid/progress'

export const MinMax = () => (
  <Progress.Root defaultValue={20} min={10} max={30}>
    <Progress.Label>Label</Progress.Label>
    <Progress.ValueText />
    <Progress.Circle>
      <Progress.CircleTrack />
      <Progress.CircleRange />
    </Progress.Circle>
  </Progress.Root>
)
```

### Indeterminate value

The progress component is determinate by default, with the value and max set to 50 and 100 respectively. To render an
indeterminate progress, you will have to set the `value` to `null`.

```tsx
import { Progress } from '@ark-ui/solid/progress'

export const Indeterminate = () => (
  <Progress.Root defaultValue={null}>
    <Progress.Label>Label</Progress.Label>
    <Progress.ValueText />
    <Progress.Circle>
      <Progress.CircleTrack />
      <Progress.CircleRange />
    </Progress.Circle>
  </Progress.Root>
)
```

### Showing a value text

Progress bars can only be interpreted by sighted users. To include a text description to support assistive technologies
like screen readers, use the `value` part in `translations`.

```tsx
import { Progress } from '@ark-ui/solid/progress'

export const ValueText = () => (
  <Progress.Root
    translations={{
      value({ value, max }) {
        if (value === null) return 'Loading...'
        return `${value} of ${max} items loaded`
      },
    }}
  >
    <Progress.Label>Label</Progress.Label>
    <Progress.ValueText />
    <Progress.Circle>
      <Progress.CircleTrack />
      <Progress.CircleRange />
    </Progress.Circle>
  </Progress.Root>
)
```

### Using the Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the progress. It accepts the value of the `useProgress` hook. You
can leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the progress.

```tsx
import { Progress, useProgress } from '@ark-ui/solid/progress'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const progress = useProgress()

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => progress().setToMax()}>Set to MAX</button>

      <Progress.RootProvider value={progress}>
        <Progress.Label>Label</Progress.Label>
        <Progress.ValueText />
        <Progress.Circle>
          <Progress.CircleTrack />
          <Progress.CircleRange />
        </Progress.Circle>
      </Progress.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

Learn how to use the `Progress` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

```tsx
import { Progress } from '@ark-ui/solid/progress'

export const Basic = () => (
  <Progress.Root defaultValue={42}>
    <Progress.Label>Label</Progress.Label>
    <Progress.ValueText />
    <Progress.Track>
      <Progress.Range />
    </Progress.Track>
  </Progress.Root>
)
```

### Set a min and max value

By default, the maximum is `100`. If that's not what you want, you can easily specify a different bound by changing the
value of the `max` prop. You can do the same with the minimum value by setting the `min` prop.

For example, to show the user a progress from `10` to `30`, you can use:

```tsx
import { Progress } from '@ark-ui/solid/progress'

export const MinMax = () => (
  <Progress.Root defaultValue={20} min={10} max={30}>
    <Progress.Label>Label</Progress.Label>
    <Progress.ValueText />
    <Progress.Track>
      <Progress.Range />
    </Progress.Track>
  </Progress.Root>
)
```

### Indeterminate progress

The progress component is determinate by default, with the value and max set to 50 and 100 respectively. To render an
indeterminate progress, you will have to set the `value` to `null`.

```tsx
import { Progress } from '@ark-ui/solid/progress'

export const Indeterminate = () => (
  <Progress.Root value={null}>
    <Progress.Label>Label</Progress.Label>
    <Progress.ValueText />
    <Progress.Track>
      <Progress.Range />
    </Progress.Track>
  </Progress.Root>
)
```

### Showing a value text

Progress bars can only be interpreted by sighted users. To include a text description to support assistive technologies
like screen readers, use the `value` part in `translations`.

```tsx
import { Progress } from '@ark-ui/solid/progress'

export const ValueText = () => (
  <Progress.Root
    translations={{
      value({ value, max }) {
        if (value === null) return 'Loading...'
        return `${value} of ${max} items loaded`
      },
    }}
  >
    <Progress.Label>Label</Progress.Label>
    <Progress.ValueText />
    <Progress.Track>
      <Progress.Range />
    </Progress.Track>
  </Progress.Root>
)
```

### Changing the orientation

By default, the progress is assumed to be horizontal. To change the orientation to vertical, set the orientation
property in the machine's context to vertical.

> Don't forget to change the styles of the vertical progress by specifying its height

```tsx
import { Progress } from '@ark-ui/solid/progress'

export const Vertical = () => (
  <Progress.Root orientation="vertical">
    <Progress.Label>Label</Progress.Label>
    <Progress.ValueText />
    <Progress.Track>
      <Progress.Range />
    </Progress.Track>
  </Progress.Root>
)
```

can leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the progress.

```tsx
import { Progress, useProgress } from '@ark-ui/solid/progress'

export const Basic = () => {
  const progress = useProgress()

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => progress().setToMax()}>Set to MAX</button>

      <Progress.Root>
        <Progress.Label>Label</Progress.Label>
        <Progress.ValueText />
        <Progress.Track>
          <Progress.Range />
        </Progress.Track>
      </Progress.Root>
    </>
  )
}
```

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

# QR Code



## Anatomy

To set up the QR code correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



## Examples

Learn how to use the `QR Code` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

```tsx
import { QrCode } from '@ark-ui/solid/qr-code'

export const Basic = () => {
  return (
    <QrCode.Root value="http://ark-ui.com">
      <QrCode.Frame>
        <QrCode.Pattern />
      </QrCode.Frame>
      <QrCode.DownloadTrigger fileName="qr-code.png" mimeType="image/png">
        Download
      </QrCode.DownloadTrigger>
    </QrCode.Root>
  )
}
```

### Download a QR Code

You can download the QR code by using the `QrCode.DownloadTrigger`. You will have to provide the `fileName` and the
`mimeType` of the image.

```tsx
<QrCode.DownloadTrigger fileName="qr-code.png" mimeType="image/png">
  Download
</QrCode.DownloadTrigger>
```

### With Overlay

You can also add a logo or overlay to the QR code. This is useful when you want to brand the QR code.

```tsx
import { QrCode } from '@ark-ui/solid/qr-code'

export const WithOverlay = () => {
  return (
    <QrCode.Root defaultValue="http://ark-ui.com">
      <QrCode.Frame>
        <QrCode.Pattern />
      </QrCode.Frame>
      <QrCode.Overlay>
        <img src="https://ark-ui.com/icon-192.png" alt="Ark UI Logo" />
      </QrCode.Overlay>
    </QrCode.Root>
  )
}
```

### Error Correction

In cases where the link is too long or the logo overlay covers a significant area, the error correction level can be
increased.

Use the `encoding.ecc` or `encoding.boostEcc` property to set the error correction level:

- `L`: Allows recovery of up to 7% data loss (default)
- `M`: Allows recovery of up to 15% data loss
- `Q`: Allows recovery of up to 25% data loss
- `H`: Allows recovery of up to 30% data loss

```tsx
import { QrCode } from '@ark-ui/solid/qr-code'

export const ErrorCorrection = () => {
  return (
    <QrCode.Root defaultValue="http://ark-ui.com" encoding={{ ecc: 'H' }}>
      <QrCode.Frame>
        <QrCode.Pattern />
      </QrCode.Frame>
    </QrCode.Root>
  )
}
```

### Using the Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the QR code. It accepts the value of the `useQrCode` hook. You can
leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the QR code.

```tsx
import { QrCode, useQrCode } from '@ark-ui/solid/qr-code'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const qrCode = useQrCode({ defaultValue: 'http://ark-ui.com' })

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => qrCode().setValue('https://ark-ui().com')}>Set Value</button>

      <QrCode.RootProvider value={qrCode}>
        <QrCode.Frame>
          <QrCode.Pattern />
        </QrCode.Frame>
      </QrCode.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

# Radio Group



## Anatomy

To set up the radio group correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



## Examples

Learn how to use the `RadioGroup` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

```tsx
import { RadioGroup } from '@ark-ui/solid/radio-group'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const Basic = () => {
  const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte']

  return (
    <RadioGroup.Root>
      <RadioGroup.Label>Framework</RadioGroup.Label>
      <RadioGroup.Indicator />
      <Index each={frameworks}>
        {(framework) => (
          <RadioGroup.Item value={framework()}>
            <RadioGroup.ItemText>{framework()}</RadioGroup.ItemText>
            <RadioGroup.ItemControl />
            <RadioGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
          </RadioGroup.Item>
        )}
      </Index>
    </RadioGroup.Root>
  )
}
```

### Disabling the radio group

To make a radio group disabled, set the `disabled` prop to `true`.

```tsx
import { RadioGroup } from '@ark-ui/solid/radio-group'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const Disabled = () => {
  const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte']

  return (
    <RadioGroup.Root disabled>
      <RadioGroup.Label>Framework</RadioGroup.Label>
      <Index each={frameworks}>
        {(framework) => (
          <RadioGroup.Item value={framework()}>
            <RadioGroup.ItemText>{framework()}</RadioGroup.ItemText>
            <RadioGroup.ItemControl />
            <RadioGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
          </RadioGroup.Item>
        )}
      </Index>
    </RadioGroup.Root>
  )
}
```

### Setting the initial value

To set the radio group's initial value, set the `defaultValue` prop to the value of the radio item to be selected by
default.

```tsx
import { RadioGroup } from '@ark-ui/solid/radio-group'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const InitialValue = () => {
  const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte']

  return (
    <RadioGroup.Root value="Solid">
      <RadioGroup.Label>Framework</RadioGroup.Label>
      <Index each={frameworks}>
        {(framework) => (
          <RadioGroup.Item value={framework()}>
            <RadioGroup.ItemText>{framework()}</RadioGroup.ItemText>
            <RadioGroup.ItemControl />
            <RadioGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
          </RadioGroup.Item>
        )}
      </Index>
    </RadioGroup.Root>
  )
}
```

### Listening for changes

When the radio group value changes, the `onValueChange` callback is invoked.

```tsx
import { RadioGroup } from '@ark-ui/solid/radio-group'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const OnEvent = () => {
  const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte']

  return (
    <RadioGroup.Root onValueChange={(details) => console.log(details.value)}>
      <RadioGroup.Label>Framework</RadioGroup.Label>
      <Index each={frameworks}>
        {(framework) => (
          <RadioGroup.Item value={framework()}>
            <RadioGroup.ItemText>{framework()}</RadioGroup.ItemText>
            <RadioGroup.ItemControl />
            <RadioGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
          </RadioGroup.Item>
        )}
      </Index>
    </RadioGroup.Root>
  )
}
```

### Using the Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the radio-group. It accepts the value of the `useRadio-group` hook.
You can leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the radio-group.

```tsx
import { RadioGroup, useRadioGroup } from '@ark-ui/solid/radio-group'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte']

  const radioGroup = useRadioGroup()

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => radioGroup().focus()}>Focus</button>

      <RadioGroup.RootProvider value={radioGroup}>
        <RadioGroup.Label>Framework</RadioGroup.Label>
        <RadioGroup.Indicator />
        <Index each={frameworks}>
          {(framework) => (
            <RadioGroup.Item value={framework()}>
              <RadioGroup.ItemText>{framework()}</RadioGroup.ItemText>
              <RadioGroup.ItemControl />
              <RadioGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
            </RadioGroup.Item>
          )}
        </Index>
      </RadioGroup.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

## Guides

### Using `asChild`

The `RadioGroup.Item` component renders as a `label` element by default. This ensures proper form semantics and
accessibility, as radio groups are form controls that require labels to provide meaningful context for users.

When using the `asChild` prop, you must **render a `label` element** as the direct child of `RadioGroup.Item` to
maintain valid HTML structure and accessibility compliance.

```tsx
// INCORRECT usage ❌
<RadioGroup.Item asChild>
  <div>
    <RadioGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
    <RadioGroup.ItemText>
      <RadioGroup.ItemControl />
    </RadioGroup.ItemText>
  </div>
</RadioGroup.Item>

// CORRECT usage ✅
<RadioGroup.Item asChild>
  <label>
    <RadioGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
    <RadioGroup.ItemText>
      <RadioGroup.ItemControl />
    </RadioGroup.ItemText>
  </label>
</RadioGroup.Item>
```

### Why `ItemHiddenInput` is required

The `RadioGroup.ItemHiddenInput` component renders a hidden HTML input element that enables proper form submission and
integration with native form behaviors. This component is essential for the radio group to function correctly as it:

- Provides the underlying input element that browsers use for form submission
- Enables integration with form libraries and validation systems
- Ensures the radio group works with native form reset functionality

```tsx
// INCORRECT usage ❌
<RadioGroup.Item>
  <RadioGroup.ItemText>
    <RadioGroup.ItemControl />
  </RadioGroup.ItemText>
</RadioGroup.Item>

// CORRECT usage ✅
<RadioGroup.Item>
  <RadioGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
  <RadioGroup.ItemText>
    <RadioGroup.ItemControl />
  </RadioGroup.ItemText>
</RadioGroup.Item>
```

# Rating Group



## Anatomy

To set up the rating correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



## Examples

Learn how to use the `RatingGroup` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

```tsx
import { RatingGroup } from '@ark-ui/solid/rating-group'
import { StarIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index, Show } from 'solid-js'

export const Basic = () => (
  <RatingGroup.Root count={5} value={3}>
    <RatingGroup.Label>Label</RatingGroup.Label>
    <RatingGroup.Control>
      <RatingGroup.Context>
        {(context) => (
          <Index each={context().items}>
            {(index) => (
              <RatingGroup.Item index={index()}>
                <RatingGroup.ItemContext>
                  {(context) => (
                    <Show when={context().highlighted} fallback={<StarIcon />}>
                      <StarIcon fill="current" />
                    </Show>
                  )}
                </RatingGroup.ItemContext>
              </RatingGroup.Item>
            )}
          </Index>
        )}
      </RatingGroup.Context>
      <RatingGroup.HiddenInput />
    </RatingGroup.Control>
  </RatingGroup.Root>
)
```

### Using half ratings

Allow `0.5` value steps by setting the `allowHalf` prop to `true`. Ensure to render the correct icon if the `isHalf`
value is set in the Rating components render callback.

```tsx
import { RatingGroup } from '@ark-ui/solid/rating-group'
import { StarHalfIcon, StarIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const HalfRatings = () => (
  <RatingGroup.Root count={5} value={3} allowHalf>
    <RatingGroup.Label>Label</RatingGroup.Label>
    <RatingGroup.Control>
      <RatingGroup.Context>
        {(context) => (
          <Index each={context().items}>
            {(index) => (
              <RatingGroup.Item index={index()}>
                <RatingGroup.ItemContext>
                  {(context) =>
                    context().half ? (
                      <StarHalfIcon fill="current" />
                    ) : context().highlighted ? (
                      <StarIcon fill="current" />
                    ) : (
                      <StarIcon />
                    )
                  }
                </RatingGroup.ItemContext>
              </RatingGroup.Item>
            )}
          </Index>
        )}
      </RatingGroup.Context>
      <RatingGroup.HiddenInput />
    </RatingGroup.Control>
  </RatingGroup.Root>
)
```

### Using a default value

```tsx
import { RatingGroup } from '@ark-ui/solid/rating-group'
import { StarIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index, Show } from 'solid-js'

export const InitialValue = () => (
  <RatingGroup.Root count={5} value={2} readOnly>
    <RatingGroup.Label>Label</RatingGroup.Label>
    <RatingGroup.Control>
      <RatingGroup.Context>
        {(context) => (
          <Index each={context().items}>
            {(index) => (
              <RatingGroup.Item index={index()}>
                <RatingGroup.ItemContext>
                  {(context) => (
                    <Show when={context().highlighted} fallback={<StarIcon />}>
                      <StarIcon fill="current" />
                    </Show>
                  )}
                </RatingGroup.ItemContext>
              </RatingGroup.Item>
            )}
          </Index>
        )}
      </RatingGroup.Context>
      <RatingGroup.HiddenInput />
    </RatingGroup.Control>
  </RatingGroup.Root>
)
```

### Controlled

When using the `RatingGroup` component, you can use the `value` and `onValueChange` props to control the state.

```tsx
import { RatingGroup } from '@ark-ui/solid/rating-group'
import { StarIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index, Show, createSignal } from 'solid-js'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = createSignal(0)

  return (
    <RatingGroup.Root count={5} value={value()} onValueChange={(details) => setValue(details.value)}>
      <RatingGroup.Label>Label</RatingGroup.Label>
      <RatingGroup.Control>
        <RatingGroup.Context>
          {(context) => (
            <Index each={context().items}>
              {(index) => (
                <RatingGroup.Item index={index()}>
                  <RatingGroup.ItemContext>
                    {(context) => (
                      <Show when={context().highlighted} fallback={<StarIcon />}>
                        <StarIcon fill="current" />
                      </Show>
                    )}
                  </RatingGroup.ItemContext>
                </RatingGroup.Item>
              )}
            </Index>
          )}
        </RatingGroup.Context>
        <RatingGroup.HiddenInput />
      </RatingGroup.Control>
    </RatingGroup.Root>
  )
}
```

### Disabling the rating group

To make the rating group disabled, set the `disabled` prop to `true`.

```tsx
import { RatingGroup } from '@ark-ui/solid/rating-group'
import { StarIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index, Show } from 'solid-js'

export const Disabled = () => (
  <RatingGroup.Root count={5} value={3} disabled>
    <RatingGroup.Label>Label</RatingGroup.Label>
    <RatingGroup.Control>
      <RatingGroup.Context>
        {(context) => (
          <Index each={context().items}>
            {(index) => (
              <RatingGroup.Item index={index()}>
                <RatingGroup.ItemContext>
                  {(context) => (
                    <Show when={context().highlighted} fallback={<StarIcon />}>
                      <StarIcon fill="current" />
                    </Show>
                  )}
                </RatingGroup.ItemContext>
              </RatingGroup.Item>
            )}
          </Index>
        )}
      </RatingGroup.Context>
      <RatingGroup.HiddenInput />
    </RatingGroup.Control>
  </RatingGroup.Root>
)
```

### Readonly rating group

To make the rating group readonly, set the `readOnly` prop to `true`.

```tsx
import { RatingGroup } from '@ark-ui/solid/rating-group'
import { StarIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index, Show } from 'solid-js'

export const ReadOnly = () => (
  <RatingGroup.Root count={5} value={3} readOnly>
    <RatingGroup.Label>Label</RatingGroup.Label>
    <RatingGroup.Control>
      <RatingGroup.Context>
        {(context) => (
          <Index each={context().items}>
            {(index) => (
              <RatingGroup.Item index={index()}>
                <RatingGroup.ItemContext>
                  {(context) => (
                    <Show when={context().highlighted} fallback={<StarIcon />}>
                      <StarIcon fill="current" />
                    </Show>
                  )}
                </RatingGroup.ItemContext>
              </RatingGroup.Item>
            )}
          </Index>
        )}
      </RatingGroup.Context>
      <RatingGroup.HiddenInput />
    </RatingGroup.Control>
  </RatingGroup.Root>
)
```

### Usage within forms

To use the rating group within forms, pass the prop `name`. It will render a hidden input and ensure the value changes
get propagated to the form correctly.

```tsx
import { RatingGroup } from '@ark-ui/solid/rating-group'
import { StarIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index, Show } from 'solid-js'

export const FormUsage = () => (
  <RatingGroup.Root name="my-rating" count={5} value={3}>
    <RatingGroup.Label>Label</RatingGroup.Label>
    <RatingGroup.Control>
      <RatingGroup.Context>
        {(context) => (
          <Index each={context().items}>
            {(index) => (
              <RatingGroup.Item index={index()}>
                <RatingGroup.ItemContext>
                  {(context) => (
                    <Show when={context().highlighted} fallback={<StarIcon />}>
                      <StarIcon fill="current" />
                    </Show>
                  )}
                </RatingGroup.ItemContext>
              </RatingGroup.Item>
            )}
          </Index>
        )}
      </RatingGroup.Context>
      <RatingGroup.HiddenInput />
    </RatingGroup.Control>
  </RatingGroup.Root>
)
```

### Using the Field Component

The `Field` component helps manage form-related state and accessibility attributes of a rating group. It includes
handling ARIA labels, helper text, and error text to ensure proper accessibility.

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'
import { RatingGroup } from '@ark-ui/solid/rating-group'
import { StarIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index, Show } from 'solid-js'

export const WithField = (props: Field.RootProps) => {
  return (
    <Field.Root {...props}>
      <RatingGroup.Root count={5} defaultValue={3}>
        <RatingGroup.Label>Label</RatingGroup.Label>
        <RatingGroup.Control>
          <RatingGroup.Context>
            {(context) => (
              <Index each={context().items}>
                {(index) => (
                  <RatingGroup.Item index={index()}>
                    <RatingGroup.ItemContext>
                      {(context) => (
                        <Show when={context().highlighted} fallback={<StarIcon />}>
                          <StarIcon fill="current" />
                        </Show>
                      )}
                    </RatingGroup.ItemContext>
                  </RatingGroup.Item>
                )}
              </Index>
            )}
          </RatingGroup.Context>
          <RatingGroup.HiddenInput />
        </RatingGroup.Control>
      </RatingGroup.Root>

      <Field.HelperText>Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
      <Field.ErrorText>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
    </Field.Root>
  )
}
```

### Using the Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the rating-group. It accepts the value of the `useRating-group`
hook. You can leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the rating-group.

```tsx
import { RatingGroup, useRatingGroup } from '@ark-ui/solid/rating-group'
import { StarIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index, Show } from 'solid-js'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const ratingGroup = useRatingGroup({ count: 5, value: 3 })

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => ratingGroup().clearValue()}>Clear</button>

      <RatingGroup.RootProvider value={ratingGroup}>
        <RatingGroup.Label>Label</RatingGroup.Label>
        <RatingGroup.Control>
          <RatingGroup.Context>
            {(context) => (
              <Index each={context().items}>
                {(index) => (
                  <RatingGroup.Item index={index()}>
                    <RatingGroup.ItemContext>
                      {(context) => (
                        <Show when={context().highlighted} fallback={<StarIcon />}>
                          <StarIcon fill="current" />
                        </Show>
                      )}
                    </RatingGroup.ItemContext>
                  </RatingGroup.Item>
                )}
              </Index>
            )}
          </RatingGroup.Context>
          <RatingGroup.HiddenInput />
        </RatingGroup.Control>
      </RatingGroup.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

# Scroll Area



## Features

- Cross-browser custom scrollbars
- Native scroll behavior
- Keyboard navigation support
- Touch and mouse support
- Horizontal and vertical scrolling
- Support for nested scroll areas
- Customizable scrollbar appearance

## Anatomy

To set up the scroll area correctly, it's essential to understand its anatomy and the naming of its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



## Required style

It's important to note that the scroll area requires the following styles on the `ScrollArea.Viewport` element to hide
the native scrollbar:

```css
[data-scope='scroll-area'][data-part='viewport'] {
  scrollbar-width: none;
  &::-webkit-scrollbar {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

## Examples

### Basic Usage

Create a basic scrollable area with custom scrollbar.

```tsx
import { ScrollArea } from '@ark-ui/solid/scroll-area'

export const Basic = () => (
  <ScrollArea.Root style={{ height: '8.5rem' }}>
    <ScrollArea.Viewport style={{ height: '100%' }}>
      <ScrollArea.Content style={{ padding: '1rem 1rem 1.5rem' }}>
        <p>

        </p>
      </ScrollArea.Content>
    </ScrollArea.Viewport>
    <ScrollArea.Scrollbar>
      <ScrollArea.Thumb />
    </ScrollArea.Scrollbar>
    <ScrollArea.Corner />
  </ScrollArea.Root>
)
```

### Horizontal Scrolling

          est laborum.
        </p>
      </ScrollArea.Content>
    </ScrollArea.Viewport>
    <ScrollArea.Scrollbar orientation="horizontal">
      <ScrollArea.Thumb />
    </ScrollArea.Scrollbar>
    <ScrollArea.Corner />
  </ScrollArea.Root>

  <ScrollArea.Root style={{ height: '300px', width: '300px' }}>
    <ScrollArea.Viewport style={{ width: '100%', height: '100%' }}>
      <ScrollArea.Content style={{ padding: '1rem' }}>

    <ScrollArea.Scrollbar orientation="horizontal">
      <ScrollArea.Thumb />
    </ScrollArea.Scrollbar>
    <ScrollArea.Corner />
  </ScrollArea.Root>
)
```

### Nested Scroll Areas

Scroll areas can be nested within each other for complex layouts.

```tsx
import { ScrollArea } from '@ark-ui/solid/scroll-area'

export const Nested = () => (
  <ScrollArea.Root style={{ height: '12rem', width: '50%' }}>
    <ScrollArea.Viewport style={{ height: '100%' }}>
      <ScrollArea.Content style={{ padding: '1rem 1rem 1.5rem' }}>
        <p>
          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore
          magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo
          consequat.
        </p>

        <ScrollArea.Root style={{ height: '8rem' }}>
          <ScrollArea.Viewport style={{ height: '100%' }}>
            <ScrollArea.Content style={{ padding: '1rem 1rem 1.5rem' }}>
              <p>
                This is a nested scroll area. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum
                dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui
                officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum. Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit
                voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore

            </ScrollArea.Content>
          </ScrollArea.Viewport>
          <ScrollArea.Scrollbar>
            <ScrollArea.Thumb />
          </ScrollArea.Scrollbar>
          <ScrollArea.Corner />
        </ScrollArea.Root>

        <p>

# Segment Group



## Anatomy

To set up the segmented control correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



## Examples

Learn how to use the `SegmentGroup` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

```tsx
import { SegmentGroup } from '@ark-ui/solid/segment-group'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const Basic = () => {
  const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Svelte', 'Vue']
  return (
    <SegmentGroup.Root>
      <SegmentGroup.Indicator />
      <Index each={frameworks}>
        {(framework) => (
          <SegmentGroup.Item value={framework()}>
            <SegmentGroup.ItemText>{framework()}</SegmentGroup.ItemText>
            <SegmentGroup.ItemControl />
            <SegmentGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
          </SegmentGroup.Item>
        )}
      </Index>
    </SegmentGroup.Root>
  )
}
```

### Initial Value

To set a default segment on initial render, use the `defaultValue` prop:

```tsx
import { SegmentGroup } from '@ark-ui/solid/segment-group'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const InitialValue = () => {
  const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Svelte', 'Vue']
  return (
    <SegmentGroup.Root value="React">
      <SegmentGroup.Indicator />
      <Index each={frameworks}>
        {(framework) => (
          <SegmentGroup.Item value={framework()}>
            <SegmentGroup.ItemText>{framework()}</SegmentGroup.ItemText>
            <SegmentGroup.ItemControl />
            <SegmentGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
          </SegmentGroup.Item>
        )}
      </Index>
    </SegmentGroup.Root>
  )
}
```

### Controlled Segment Group

To create a controlled SegmentGroup component, manage the current selected segment using the `value` prop and update it
when the `onValueChange` event handler is called:

```tsx
import { SegmentGroup } from '@ark-ui/solid/segment-group'
import { Index, createSignal } from 'solid-js'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Svelte', 'Vue']
  const [value, setValue] = createSignal<string | null>('React')

  return (
    <SegmentGroup.Root value={value()} onValueChange={(e) => setValue(e.value)}>
      <SegmentGroup.Indicator />
      <Index each={frameworks}>
        {(framework) => (
          <SegmentGroup.Item value={framework()}>
            <SegmentGroup.ItemText>{framework()}</SegmentGroup.ItemText>
            <SegmentGroup.ItemControl />
            <SegmentGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
          </SegmentGroup.Item>
        )}
      </Index>
    </SegmentGroup.Root>
  )
}
```

### Disabled Segment

To disable a segment, simply pass the `disabled` prop to the `SegmentGroup.Item` component:

```tsx
import { SegmentGroup } from '@ark-ui/solid/segment-group'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const Disabled = () => {
  const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Svelte', 'Vue']
  return (
    <SegmentGroup.Root value={'React'}>
      <SegmentGroup.Indicator />
      <Index each={frameworks}>
        {(framework) => (
          <SegmentGroup.Item value={framework()} disabled={framework() === 'Svelte'}>
            <SegmentGroup.ItemText>{framework()}</SegmentGroup.ItemText>
            <SegmentGroup.ItemControl />
            <SegmentGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
          </SegmentGroup.Item>
        )}
      </Index>
    </SegmentGroup.Root>
  )
}
```

### Using the Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the radio-group. It accepts the value of the `useRadio-group` hook.
You can leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the radio-group.

```tsx
import { SegmentGroup, useSegmentGroup } from '@ark-ui/solid/segment-group'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const frameworks = ['React', 'Solid', 'Svelte', 'Vue']
  const segmentGroup = useSegmentGroup()

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => segmentGroup().focus()}>Focus</button>

      <SegmentGroup.RootProvider value={segmentGroup}>
        <SegmentGroup.Indicator />
        <Index each={frameworks}>
          {(framework) => (
            <SegmentGroup.Item value={framework()}>
              <SegmentGroup.ItemText>{framework()}</SegmentGroup.ItemText>
              <SegmentGroup.ItemControl />
              <SegmentGroup.ItemHiddenInput />
            </SegmentGroup.Item>
          )}
        </Index>
      </SegmentGroup.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

## API Reference

<ComponentTypes id="radio-group" replace={{ 'radio-group': 'segment-group', 'radio group': 'segment group' }} />

## Accessibility

Complies with the [Radio WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/radio/).

### Keyboard Support

**`Tab`**
Description: Moves focus to either the checked radio item or the first radio item in the group.

**`Space`**
Description: When focus is on an unchecked radio item, checks it.

**`ArrowDown`**
Description: Moves focus and checks the next radio item in the group.

**`ArrowRight`**
Description: Moves focus and checks the next radio item in the group.

**`ArrowUp`**
Description: Moves focus to the previous radio item in the group.

**`ArrowLeft`**
Description: Moves focus to the previous radio item in the group.


# Select



## Anatomy

To set up the select correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



## Examples

Learn how to use the `Select` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

```tsx
import { Select, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/select'
import { Index, Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const Basic = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({ items: ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte'] })

  return (
    <Select.Root collection={collection}>
      <Select.Label>Framework</Select.Label>
      <Select.Control>
        <Select.Trigger>
          <Select.ValueText placeholder="Select a Framework" />
          <Select.Indicator>▼</Select.Indicator>
        </Select.Trigger>
        <Select.ClearTrigger>Clear</Select.ClearTrigger>
      </Select.Control>
      <Portal>
        <Select.Positioner>
          <Select.Content>
            <Select.ItemGroup>
              <Select.ItemGroupLabel>Frameworks</Select.ItemGroupLabel>
              <Index each={collection.items}>
                {(item) => (
                  <Select.Item item={item()}>
                    <Select.ItemText>{item()}</Select.ItemText>
                    <Select.ItemIndicator>✓</Select.ItemIndicator>
                  </Select.Item>
                )}
              </Index>
            </Select.ItemGroup>
          </Select.Content>
        </Select.Positioner>
      </Portal>
      <Select.HiddenSelect />
    </Select.Root>
  )
}
```

### Controlled Value

Use the `value` and `onValueChange` props to control the selected items.

```tsx
import { Select, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/select'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import { Index, Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

interface Item {
  label: string
  value: string
  disabled?: boolean
}

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [, setSelectedItems] = createSignal<Item[]>([])

  const collection = createListCollection<Item>({
    items: [
      { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
      { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
      { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
      { label: 'Svelte', value: 'svelte', disabled: true },
    ],
  })

  return (
    <Select.Root collection={collection} onValueChange={(e) => setSelectedItems(e.items)}>
      <Select.Label>Framework</Select.Label>
      <Select.Control>
        <Select.Trigger>
          <Select.ValueText placeholder="Select a Framework" />
        </Select.Trigger>
        <Select.ClearTrigger>Clear</Select.ClearTrigger>
      </Select.Control>
      <Portal>
        <Select.Positioner>
          <Select.Content>
            <Select.ItemGroup>
              <Select.ItemGroupLabel>Frameworks</Select.ItemGroupLabel>
              <Index each={collection.items}>
                {(item) => (
                  <Select.Item item={item()}>
                    <Select.ItemText>{item().label}</Select.ItemText>
                    <Select.ItemIndicator>✓</Select.ItemIndicator>
                  </Select.Item>
                )}
              </Index>
            </Select.ItemGroup>
          </Select.Content>
        </Select.Positioner>
      </Portal>
      <Select.HiddenSelect />
    </Select.Root>
  )
}
```

### Grouping

Grouping related options can be useful for organizing options into categories.

- Use the `groupBy` prop to configure the grouping of the items.
- Use the `collection.group()` method to get the grouped items.
- Use the `Select.ItemGroup` and `Select.ItemGroupLabel` components to render the grouped items.

```tsx
import { Select, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/select'
import { For, Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const Grouping = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({
    items: [
      { label: 'React', value: 'react', type: 'JS' },
      { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid', type: 'JS' },
      { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue', type: 'JS' },
      { label: 'Panda', value: 'panda', type: 'CSS' },
      { label: 'Tailwind', value: 'tailwind', type: 'CSS' },
    ],
    groupBy: (item) => item.type,
  })
  return (
    <Select.Root collection={collection}>
      <Select.Label>Framework</Select.Label>
      <Select.Control>
        <Select.Trigger>
          <Select.ValueText placeholder="Select a Framework" />
        </Select.Trigger>
        <Select.ClearTrigger>Clear</Select.ClearTrigger>
      </Select.Control>
      <Portal>
        <Select.Positioner>
          <Select.Content>
            <For each={collection.group()}>
              {([type, group]) => (
                <Select.ItemGroup>
                  <Select.ItemGroupLabel>{type}</Select.ItemGroupLabel>
                  <For each={group}>
                    {(item) => (
                      <Select.Item item={item}>
                        <Select.ItemText>{item.label}</Select.ItemText>
                        <Select.ItemIndicator>✓</Select.ItemIndicator>
                      </Select.Item>
                    )}
                  </For>
                </Select.ItemGroup>
              )}
            </For>
          </Select.Content>
        </Select.Positioner>
      </Portal>
      <Select.HiddenSelect />
    </Select.Root>
  )
}
```

### Multiple Selection

To enable `multiple` item selection:

```tsx
import { Select, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/select'
import { ChevronDownIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index, Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const Multiple = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({
    items: [
      { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
      { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
      { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
      { label: 'Svelte', value: 'svelte', disabled: true },
    ],
  })
  return (
    <Select.Root collection={collection} multiple>
      <Select.Label>Framework</Select.Label>
      <Select.Control>
        <Select.Trigger>
          <Select.ValueText placeholder="Select a Framework" />
          <Select.Indicator>
            <ChevronDownIcon />
          </Select.Indicator>
        </Select.Trigger>
        <Select.ClearTrigger>Clear</Select.ClearTrigger>
      </Select.Control>
      <Portal>
        <Select.Positioner>
          <Select.Content>
            <Select.ItemGroup>
              <Select.ItemGroupLabel>Frameworks</Select.ItemGroupLabel>
              <Index each={collection.items}>
                {(item) => (
                  <Select.Item item={item()}>
                    <Select.ItemText>{item().label}</Select.ItemText>
                    <Select.ItemIndicator>✓</Select.ItemIndicator>
                  </Select.Item>
                )}
              </Index>
            </Select.ItemGroup>
          </Select.Content>
        </Select.Positioner>
      </Portal>
      <Select.HiddenSelect />
    </Select.Root>
  )
}
```

### Form Library

Here's an example of integrating the `Select` component with a form library.

```tsx
import { Select, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid'
import { createForm, getValue, setValue } from '@modular-forms/solid'
import { createMemo } from 'solid-js'
import { Index, Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const FormLibrary = () => {
  const frameworks = createListCollection({
    items: [
      { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
      { label: 'Solid', value: 'solid' },
      { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
    ],
  })

  const [formStore, { Form, Field }] = createForm({
    initialValues: { value: 'solid' },
  })

  const value = createMemo(() => getValue(formStore, 'value'))

  return (
    <>
      <div>Value is {value()}</div>
      <Form
        onSubmit={(e) => {
          console.log(e.value)
        }}
      >
        <Field name="value">
          {(field, props) => (
            <Select.Root
              collection={frameworks}
              value={field.value ? [field.value] : []}
              invalid={!!field.error}
              name={field.name}
              onValueChange={(e) => {
                setValue(formStore, field.name, e.value[0])
              }}
            >
              <Select.Control>
                <Select.Trigger>
                  <Select.ValueText placeholder="Select a Framework" />
                </Select.Trigger>
                <Select.ClearTrigger>Clear</Select.ClearTrigger>
              </Select.Control>
              <Portal>
                <Select.Positioner>
                  <Select.Content>
                    <Select.ItemGroup>
                      <Select.ItemGroupLabel>Frameworks</Select.ItemGroupLabel>
                      <Index each={frameworks.items}>
                        {(item) => (
                          <Select.Item item={item()}>
                            <Select.ItemText>{item().label}</Select.ItemText>
                            <Select.ItemIndicator>✓</Select.ItemIndicator>
                          </Select.Item>
                        )}
                      </Index>
                    </Select.ItemGroup>
                  </Select.Content>
                </Select.Positioner>
              </Portal>
              <Select.HiddenSelect {...props} />
            </Select.Root>
          )}
        </Field>
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </Form>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Field Component

The `Field` component helps manage form-related state and accessibility attributes of a select. It includes handling
ARIA labels, helper text, and error text to ensure proper accessibility.

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'
import { Select, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/select'
import { ChevronDownIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js/web'

export const WithField = (props: Field.RootProps) => {
  const collection = createListCollection({ items: ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte'] })

  return (
    <Field.Root {...props}>
      <Select.Root collection={collection}>
        <Select.Label>Label</Select.Label>
        <Select.Control>
          <Select.Trigger>
            <Select.ValueText placeholder="Select a Framework" />
            <Select.Indicator>
              <ChevronDownIcon />
            </Select.Indicator>
          </Select.Trigger>
        </Select.Control>
        <Select.Positioner>
          <Select.Content>
            <Select.ItemGroup>
              <Select.ItemGroupLabel>Frameworks</Select.ItemGroupLabel>
              <Index each={collection.items}>
                {(item) => (
                  <Select.Item item={item()}>
                    <Select.ItemText>{item()}</Select.ItemText>
                    <Select.ItemIndicator>✓</Select.ItemIndicator>
                  </Select.Item>
                )}
              </Index>
            </Select.ItemGroup>
          </Select.Content>
        </Select.Positioner>
        <Select.HiddenSelect />
      </Select.Root>
      <Field.HelperText>Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
      <Field.ErrorText>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
    </Field.Root>
  )
}
```

### Async Loading

Here's an example of how to load the items asynchronously when the select is opened.

```tsx
import { Select, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/select'
import { Index, Show, createMemo, createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

function loadData() {
  return new Promise<string[]>((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve(['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte', 'Angular', 'Ember']), 500)
  })
}

export const Async = () => {
  const [items, setItems] = createSignal<string[] | null>(null)
  const [loading, setLoading] = createSignal(false)
  const [error, setError] = createSignal<Error | null>(null)

  const collection = createMemo(() =>
    createListCollection<string>({
      items: items() || [],
    }),
  )

  const handleOpenChange = (details: Select.OpenChangeDetails) => {
    if (details.open && items() === null) {
      setLoading(true)
      setError(null)
      loadData()
        .then((data) => setItems(data))
        .catch((err) => setError(err))
        .finally(() => setLoading(false))
    }
  }

  return (
    <Select.Root collection={collection()} onOpenChange={handleOpenChange}>
      <Select.Label>Framework</Select.Label>
      <Select.Control>
        <Select.Trigger>
          <Select.ValueText placeholder="Select" />
          <Select.Indicator>▼</Select.Indicator>
        </Select.Trigger>
        <Select.ClearTrigger>Clear</Select.ClearTrigger>
      </Select.Control>
      <Portal>
        <Select.Positioner>
          <Select.Content>
            <Show when={loading()}>
              <div>Loading...</div>
            </Show>
            <Show when={error()}>
              <div>Error: {error()?.message}</div>
            </Show>
            <Show when={items() !== null && !loading() && !error()}>
              <Index each={collection().items}>
                {(item) => (
                  <Select.Item item={item()}>
                    <Select.ItemText>{item()}</Select.ItemText>
                    <Select.ItemIndicator>✓</Select.ItemIndicator>
                  </Select.Item>
                )}
              </Index>
            </Show>
          </Select.Content>
        </Select.Positioner>
      </Portal>
      <Select.HiddenSelect />
    </Select.Root>
  )
}
```

### Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the select. It accepts the value of the `useSelect` hook. You can
leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the select.

```tsx
import { Select, createListCollection, useSelect } from '@ark-ui/solid/select'
import { Index, Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({ items: ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte'] })

  const select = useSelect({ collection: collection })

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => select().focus()}>Focus</button>

      <Select.RootProvider value={select}>
        <Select.Label>Framework</Select.Label>
        <Select.Control>
          <Select.Trigger>
            <Select.ValueText placeholder="Select a Framework" />
            <Select.Indicator>▼</Select.Indicator>
          </Select.Trigger>
          <Select.ClearTrigger>Clear</Select.ClearTrigger>
        </Select.Control>
        <Portal>
          <Select.Positioner>
            <Select.Content>
              <Select.ItemGroup>
                <Select.ItemGroupLabel>Frameworks</Select.ItemGroupLabel>
                <Index each={collection.items}>
                  {(item) => (
                    <Select.Item item={item()}>
                      <Select.ItemText>{item()}</Select.ItemText>
                      <Select.ItemIndicator>✓</Select.ItemIndicator>
                    </Select.Item>
                  )}
                </Index>
              </Select.ItemGroup>
            </Select.Content>
          </Select.Positioner>
        </Portal>
        <Select.HiddenSelect />
      </Select.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

### Select on Highlight

Here's an example of automatically selecting items when they are highlighted (hovered or navigated to with keyboard).

```tsx
import { Select, createListCollection, useSelect } from '@ark-ui/solid/select'
import { Index, Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const SelectOnHighlight = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({
    items: ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte'],
  })

  const select = useSelect({
    collection,
    onHighlightChange({ highlightedValue }) {
      if (highlightedValue) {
        select().selectValue(highlightedValue)
      }
    },
  })

  return (
    <Select.RootProvider value={select}>
      <Select.Label>Framework</Select.Label>
      <Select.Control>
        <Select.Trigger>
          <Select.ValueText placeholder="Select a Framework" />
          <Select.Indicator>▼</Select.Indicator>
        </Select.Trigger>
        <Select.ClearTrigger>Clear</Select.ClearTrigger>
      </Select.Control>
      <Portal>
        <Select.Positioner>
          <Select.Content>
            <Select.ItemGroup>
              <Select.ItemGroupLabel>Frameworks</Select.ItemGroupLabel>
              <Index each={collection.items}>
                {(item) => (
                  <Select.Item item={item()}>
                    <Select.ItemText>{item()}</Select.ItemText>
                    <Select.ItemIndicator>✓</Select.ItemIndicator>
                  </Select.Item>
                )}
              </Index>
            </Select.ItemGroup>
          </Select.Content>
        </Select.Positioner>
      </Portal>
      <Select.HiddenSelect />
    </Select.RootProvider>
  )
}
```

### Maximum Selected Items

Here's an example of limiting the number of items that can be selected in a multiple select.

```tsx
import { Select, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/select'
import { Index, createMemo, createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

const items = ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte']

export const MaxSelected = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = createSignal<string[]>([])
  const maxSelected = 2

  const hasReachedMax = (value: string[]) => value.length >= maxSelected

  const collection = createMemo(() =>
    createListCollection({
      items: items.map((item) => ({
        label: item,
        value: item,
        disabled: hasReachedMax(value()) && !value().includes(item),
      })),
    }),
  )

  const handleValueChange = (details: Select.ValueChangeDetails) => {
    if (hasReachedMax(value()) && details.value.length) return
    setValue(details.value)
  }

  return (
    <Select.Root collection={collection()} multiple value={value()} onValueChange={handleValueChange}>
      <Select.Label>Framework</Select.Label>
      <Select.Control>
        <Select.Trigger>
          <Select.ValueText placeholder="Select a Framework" />
          <Select.Indicator>▼</Select.Indicator>
        </Select.Trigger>
        <Select.ClearTrigger>Clear</Select.ClearTrigger>
      </Select.Control>
      <Portal>
        <Select.Positioner>
          <Select.Content>
            <Select.ItemGroup>
              <Select.ItemGroupLabel>Frameworks</Select.ItemGroupLabel>
              <Index each={collection().items}>
                {(item) => (
                  <Select.Item item={item()}>
                    <Select.ItemText>{item().label}</Select.ItemText>
                    <Select.ItemIndicator>✓</Select.ItemIndicator>
                  </Select.Item>
                )}
              </Index>
            </Select.ItemGroup>
          </Select.Content>
        </Select.Positioner>
      </Portal>
      <Select.HiddenSelect />
    </Select.Root>
  )
}
```

### Lazy Mount

The `lazyMount` and `unmountOnExit` props allow you to control when the select content is mounted and unmounted from the
DOM. This can improve performance by only rendering the content when needed.

```tsx
import { Select, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/select'
import { Index, Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const LazyMount = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({
    items: ['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte', 'Angular', 'Alpine'],
  })

  return (
    <Select.Root collection={collection} lazyMount unmountOnExit>
      <Select.Label>Framework</Select.Label>
      <Select.Control>
        <Select.Trigger>
          <Select.ValueText placeholder="Select a Framework" />
          <Select.Indicator>▼</Select.Indicator>
        </Select.Trigger>
        <Select.ClearTrigger>Clear</Select.ClearTrigger>
      </Select.Control>
      <Portal>
        <Select.Positioner>
          <Select.Content>
            <Select.ItemGroup>
              <Select.ItemGroupLabel>Frameworks</Select.ItemGroupLabel>
              <Index each={collection.items}>
                {(item) => (
                  <Select.Item item={item()}>
                    <Select.ItemText>{item()}</Select.ItemText>
                    <Select.ItemIndicator>✓</Select.ItemIndicator>
                  </Select.Item>
                )}
              </Index>
            </Select.ItemGroup>
          </Select.Content>
        </Select.Positioner>
      </Portal>
      <Select.HiddenSelect />
    </Select.Root>
  )
}
```

## Guides

### Type-Safety

The `Select.RootComponent` type enables you to create closed, strongly typed wrapper components that maintain full type
safety for collection items.

This is particularly useful when building reusable select components with custom props and consistent styling.

```tsx
import { Select as ArkSelect, type CollectionItem } from '@ark-ui/react/select'
import { createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/collection'

interface SelectProps<T extends CollectionItem> extends ArkSelect.RootProps<T> {}

const Select: ArkSelect.RootComponent = (props) => {
  return <ArkSelect.Root {...props}>{/* ... */}</ArkSelect.Root>
}
```

Then, you can use the `Select` component as follows:

```tsx
const App = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({
    initialItems: [
      { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
      { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
      { label: 'Svelte', value: 'svelte' },
    ],
  })
  return (
    <Select
      collection={collection}
      onValueChange={(e) => {
        // this will be strongly typed Array<{ label: string, value: string }>
        console.log(e.items)
      }}
    >
      {/* ... */}
    </Select>
  )
}
```

### Usage in Popover or Dialog

When using the Select component within a `Popover` or `Dialog`, avoid rendering its content within a `Portal` or
`Teleport`.

This ensures the Select's content stays within the Popover/Dialog's DOM hierarchy rather than being portalled to the
document body, maintaining proper interaction and accessibility behavior.

### Hidden Select

The `Select.HiddenSelect` component renders a native HTML `<select>` element that's visually hidden but remains in the
DOM. This component is essential for:

- **Form submission**: Native form submission and serialization work seamlessly since the actual `<select>` element
  exists in the DOM
- **Browser auto-fill**: Browsers can properly auto-fill the select based on previously submitted form data
- **Progressive enhancement**: Forms remain functional even if JavaScript fails to load

```tsx
<Select.Root>
  <Select.HiddenSelect />
  {/* Other Select components */}
</Select.Root>
```

The hidden select automatically syncs with the Select component's value, ensuring form data is always up-to-date.

### Empty State

You can create an empty state component that displays when there are no items in the collection. Use the
`useSelectContext` hook to check the collection size:

```tsx
const SelectEmpty = (props: React.ComponentProps<'div'>) => {
  const select = useSelectContext()
  if (select.collection.size === 0) {
    return <div {...props} role="presentation" />
  }
  return null
}
```

Then use it within your Select content:

```tsx
<Select.Content>
  <SelectEmpty>No items to display</SelectEmpty>
  {/* Your items */}
</Select.Content>
```

### Available height and width

The following css variables are exposed to the `Select.Positioner` which you can use to style the `Select.Content`

```css
/* width of the select trigger */
--reference-width: <pixel-value>;
/* width of the available viewport */
--available-width: <pixel-value>;
/* height of the available viewport */
--available-height: <pixel-value>;
```

For example, if you want to make sure the maximum height doesn't exceed the available height, you can use the following:

```css
[data-scope='select'][data-part='content'] {
  max-height: calc(var(--available-height) - 100px);
}
```

# Signature Pad



## Anatomy

To set up the signature pad correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



## Examples

Learn how to use the `Signature Pad` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

```tsx
import { SignaturePad } from '@ark-ui/solid/signature-pad'

export const Basic = () => (
  <SignaturePad.Root>
    <SignaturePad.Label>Sign below</SignaturePad.Label>
    <SignaturePad.Control>
      <SignaturePad.Segment />
      <SignaturePad.ClearTrigger>Clear</SignaturePad.ClearTrigger>
      <SignaturePad.Guide />
    </SignaturePad.Control>
  </SignaturePad.Root>
)
```

### Image Preview

After the user draws a signature, you can display a preview of the signature as an image. This is useful when you want
to show the user a preview of the signature before saving it.

```tsx
import { SignaturePad } from '@ark-ui/solid/signature-pad'
import { Show, createSignal } from 'solid-js'

export const ImagePreview = () => {
  const [imageUrl, setImageUrl] = createSignal<string>()

  return (
    <>
      <SignaturePad.Root onDrawEnd={(details) => details.getDataUrl('image/png').then((url) => setImageUrl(url))}>
        <SignaturePad.Label>Sign below</SignaturePad.Label>
        <SignaturePad.Control>
          <SignaturePad.Segment fill="orange" />
          <SignaturePad.ClearTrigger>Clear</SignaturePad.ClearTrigger>
          <SignaturePad.Guide />
        </SignaturePad.Control>
      </SignaturePad.Root>
      <Show when={imageUrl()}>
        <img src={imageUrl()} alt="Signature" />
      </Show>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Using the Field Component

The `Field` component helps manage form-related state and accessibility attributes of a signature pad. It includes
handling ARIA labels, helper text, and error text to ensure proper accessibility.

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'
import { SignaturePad } from '@ark-ui/solid/signature-pad'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'

export const WithField = (props: Field.RootProps) => {
  const [value, setValue] = createSignal('')

  return (
    <Field.Root {...props}>
      <SignaturePad.Root onDrawEnd={(details) => details.getDataUrl('image/png').then((url) => setValue(url))}>
        <SignaturePad.Label>Label</SignaturePad.Label>
        <SignaturePad.Control>
          <SignaturePad.Segment />
          <SignaturePad.ClearTrigger>Clear</SignaturePad.ClearTrigger>
          <SignaturePad.Guide />
        </SignaturePad.Control>
        <SignaturePad.HiddenInput value={value()} />
      </SignaturePad.Root>
      <Field.HelperText>Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
      <Field.ErrorText>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
    </Field.Root>
  )
}
```

### Using the Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the signature-pad. It accepts the value of the `useSignature-pad`
hook. You can leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the signature-pad.

```tsx
import { SignaturePad, useSignaturePad } from '@ark-ui/solid/signature-pad'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const signaturePad = useSignaturePad()

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => signaturePad().clear()}>Clear</button>

      <SignaturePad.RootProvider value={signaturePad}>
        <SignaturePad.Label>Sign below</SignaturePad.Label>
        <SignaturePad.Control>
          <SignaturePad.Segment />
          <SignaturePad.ClearTrigger>Clear</SignaturePad.ClearTrigger>
          <SignaturePad.Guide />
        </SignaturePad.Control>
      </SignaturePad.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

# Slider



## Anatomy

To set up the slider correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



## Examples

Learn how to use the `Slider` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

```tsx
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/solid/slider'

export const Basic = () => {
  return (
    <Slider.Root>
      <Slider.Label>Label</Slider.Label>
      <Slider.ValueText />
      <Slider.Control>
        <Slider.Track>
          <Slider.Range />
        </Slider.Track>
        <Slider.Thumb index={0}>
          <Slider.HiddenInput />
        </Slider.Thumb>
      </Slider.Control>
    </Slider.Root>
  )
}
```

### Range Slider

You can add multiple thumbs to the slider by adding multiple `Slider.Thumb`

```tsx
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/solid/slider'

export const Range = () => {
  return (
    <Slider.Root value={[5, 10]}>
      <Slider.Label>Label</Slider.Label>
      <Slider.ValueText />
      <Slider.Control>
        <Slider.Track>
          <Slider.Range />
        </Slider.Track>
        <Slider.Thumb index={0}>
          <Slider.HiddenInput />
        </Slider.Thumb>
        <Slider.Thumb index={1}>
          <Slider.HiddenInput />
        </Slider.Thumb>
      </Slider.Control>
    </Slider.Root>
  )
}
```

### Adding marks

You can add marks to the slider track by using the `Slider.MarkerGroup` and `Slider.Marker` components.

Position the `Slider.Marker` components relative to the track by providing the `value` prop.

```tsx
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/solid/slider'

export const WithMarks = () => {
  return (
    <Slider.Root>
      <Slider.Label>Label</Slider.Label>
      <Slider.ValueText />
      <Slider.Control>
        <Slider.Track>
          <Slider.Range />
        </Slider.Track>
        <Slider.Thumb index={0}>
          <Slider.HiddenInput />
        </Slider.Thumb>
      </Slider.Control>
      <Slider.MarkerGroup>
        <Slider.Marker value={0}>0</Slider.Marker>
        <Slider.Marker value={25}>*</Slider.Marker>
        <Slider.Marker value={50}>50</Slider.Marker>
        <Slider.Marker value={75}>*</Slider.Marker>
      </Slider.MarkerGroup>
    </Slider.Root>
  )
}
```

### Setting the initial value

To set the slider's initial value, set the `defaultValue` prop to the array of numbers.

```tsx
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/solid/slider'

export const InitialValue = () => (
  <Slider.Root value={[42]}>
    <Slider.Label>Label</Slider.Label>
    <Slider.ValueText />
    <Slider.Control>
      <Slider.Track>
        <Slider.Range />
      </Slider.Track>
      <Slider.Thumb index={0}>
        <Slider.HiddenInput />
      </Slider.Thumb>
    </Slider.Control>
    <Slider.MarkerGroup>
      <Slider.Marker value={0}>*</Slider.Marker>
      <Slider.Marker value={30}>*</Slider.Marker>
      <Slider.Marker value={60}>*</Slider.Marker>
    </Slider.MarkerGroup>
  </Slider.Root>
)
```

### Specifying the minimum and maximum

By default, the minimum is `0` and the maximum is `100`. If that's not what you want, you can easily specify different
bounds by changing the values of the `min` and/or `max` props.

For example, to ask the user for a value between `-10` and `10`, you can use:

```tsx
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/solid/slider'

export const MinMax = () => {
  return (
    <Slider.Root min={-10} max={10}>
      <Slider.Label>Label</Slider.Label>
      <Slider.ValueText />
      <Slider.Control>
        <Slider.Track>
          <Slider.Range />
        </Slider.Track>
        <Slider.Thumb index={0}>
          <Slider.HiddenInput />
        </Slider.Thumb>
      </Slider.Control>
    </Slider.Root>
  )
}
```

### Setting the value's granularity

By default, the granularity, is `1`, meaning that the value is always an integer. You can change the step attribute to
control the granularity.

For example, If you need a value between `5` and `10`, accurate to two decimal places, you should set the value of step
to `0.01`:

```tsx
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/solid/slider'

export const Step = () => {
  return (
    <Slider.Root step={0.01} min={5} max={10}>
      <Slider.Label>Label</Slider.Label>
      <Slider.ValueText />
      <Slider.Control>
        <Slider.Track>
          <Slider.Range />
        </Slider.Track>
        <Slider.Thumb index={0}>
          <Slider.HiddenInput />
        </Slider.Thumb>
      </Slider.Control>
    </Slider.Root>
  )
}
```

### Listening for changes

When the slider value changes, the `onValueChange` and `onValueChangeEnd` callbacks are invoked. You can use this to set
up custom behaviors in your app.

```tsx
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/solid/slider'

export const OnEvent = () => {
  return (
    <Slider.Root
      onValueChange={(details) => console.log(details.value)}
      onValueChangeEnd={(details) => console.log(details.value)}
    >
      <Slider.Label>Label</Slider.Label>
      <Slider.ValueText />
      <Slider.Control>
        <Slider.Track>
          <Slider.Range />
        </Slider.Track>
        <Slider.Thumb index={0}>
          <Slider.HiddenInput />
        </Slider.Thumb>
      </Slider.Control>
    </Slider.Root>
  )
}
```

### Changing the orientation

By default, the slider is assumed to be horizontal. To change the orientation to vertical, set the orientation property
in the machine's context to vertical.

In this mode, the slider will use the arrow up and down keys to increment/decrement its value.

> Don't forget to change the styles of the vertical slider by specifying its height

```tsx
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/solid/slider'

export const Vertical = () => {
  return (
    <Slider.Root orientation="vertical">
      <Slider.Label>Label</Slider.Label>
      <Slider.ValueText />
      <Slider.Control>
        <Slider.Track>
          <Slider.Range />
        </Slider.Track>
        <Slider.Thumb index={0}>
          <Slider.HiddenInput />
        </Slider.Thumb>
      </Slider.Control>
    </Slider.Root>
  )
}
```

### Changing the origin

By default, the slider's origin is at the start of the track. To change the origin to the center of the track, set the
`origin` prop to `center`.

```tsx
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/solid/slider'

export const CenterOrigin = () => {
  return (
    <Slider.Root origin="center">
      <Slider.Label>Label</Slider.Label>
      <Slider.ValueText />
      <Slider.Control>
        <Slider.Track>
          <Slider.Range />
        </Slider.Track>
        <Slider.Thumb index={0}>
          <Slider.HiddenInput />
        </Slider.Thumb>
      </Slider.Control>
    </Slider.Root>
  )
}
```

### Using the Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the slider. It accepts the value of the `useSlider` hook. You can
leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the slider.

```tsx
import { Slider, useSlider } from '@ark-ui/solid/slider'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const slider = useSlider()

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => slider().focus()}>Focus</button>

      <Slider.RootProvider value={slider}>
        <Slider.Label>Label</Slider.Label>
        <Slider.ValueText />
        <Slider.Control>
          <Slider.Track>
            <Slider.Range />
          </Slider.Track>
          <Slider.Thumb index={0}>
            <Slider.HiddenInput />
          </Slider.Thumb>
        </Slider.Control>
      </Slider.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

# Splitter



## Anatomy

To set up the splitter correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



## Examples

Learn how to use the `Splitter` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

```tsx
import { Splitter } from '@ark-ui/solid/splitter'

export const Basic = () => (
  <Splitter.Root panels={[{ id: 'a' }, { id: 'b' }]}>
    <Splitter.Panel id="a">A</Splitter.Panel>
    <Splitter.ResizeTrigger id="a:b" aria-label="Resize" />
    <Splitter.Panel id="b">B</Splitter.Panel>
  </Splitter.Root>
)
```

### Using Render Props

The Splitter component allows you to pass a function as a child to gain direct access to its API. This provides more
control and allows you to modify the size of the panels programmatically:

```tsx
import { Splitter } from '@ark-ui/solid/splitter'

export const RenderProp = () => (
  <Splitter.Root defaultSize={[50, 50]} panels={[{ id: 'a' }, { id: 'b' }]}>
    <Splitter.Context>
      {(api) => (
        <>
          <Splitter.Panel id="a">
            <button type="button" onClick={() => api().resizePanel('a', 10)}>
              Set to 10%
            </button>
          </Splitter.Panel>
          <Splitter.ResizeTrigger id="a:b" aria-label="Resize" />
          <Splitter.Panel id="b">
            <button type="button" onClick={() => api().resizePanel('b', 10)}>
              Set to 10%
            </button>
          </Splitter.Panel>
        </>
      )}
    </Splitter.Context>
  </Splitter.Root>
)
```

### Handling Events

Splitter also provides `onResizeStart`, `onResize`, and `onResizeEnd` events which can be useful to perform some actions
during the start and end of the resizing process:

```tsx
import { Splitter } from '@ark-ui/solid/splitter'

export const Events = () => (
  <Splitter.Root
    panels={[{ id: 'a' }, { id: 'b' }]}
    defaultSize={[50, 50]}
    onResizeStart={() => console.log('onResizeStart')}
    onResizeEnd={(details) => console.log('onResizeEnd', details)}
    onExpand={(details) => console.log('onExpand', details)}
    onCollapse={(details) => console.log('onCollapse', details)}
  >
    <Splitter.Panel id="a">A</Splitter.Panel>
    <Splitter.ResizeTrigger id="a:b" aria-label="Resize" />
    <Splitter.Panel id="b">B</Splitter.Panel>
  </Splitter.Root>
)
```

### Vertical Splitter

By default, the Splitter component is horizontal. If you need a vertical splitter, use the `orientation` prop:

```tsx
import { Splitter } from '@ark-ui/solid/splitter'

export const Vertical = () => (
  <Splitter.Root orientation="vertical" defaultSize={[50, 50]} panels={[{ id: 'a' }, { id: 'b' }]}>
    <Splitter.Panel id="a">A</Splitter.Panel>
    <Splitter.ResizeTrigger id="a:b" aria-label="Resize" />
    <Splitter.Panel id="b">B</Splitter.Panel>
  </Splitter.Root>
)
```

### Collapsible Panels

To make a panel collapsible, set the `collapsible` prop to `true` on the panel you want to make collapsible.
Additionally, you can use the `collapsedSize` prop to set the size of the panel when it's collapsed.

> This can be useful for building sidebar layouts.

```tsx
import { Splitter } from '@ark-ui/solid/splitter'

export const Collapsible = () => (
  <Splitter.Root
    defaultSize={[15, 20]}
    panels={[
      { id: 'a', collapsible: true, collapsedSize: 5, minSize: 10, maxSize: 20 },
      { id: 'b', minSize: 50 },
    ]}
  >
    <Splitter.Panel id="a">A</Splitter.Panel>
    <Splitter.ResizeTrigger id="a:b" aria-label="Resize" />
    <Splitter.Panel id="b">B</Splitter.Panel>
  </Splitter.Root>
)
```

### Multiple Panels

Here's an example of how to use the `Splitter` component with multiple panels.

```tsx
import { Splitter } from '@ark-ui/solid/splitter'

export const MultiplePanels = () => (
  <Splitter.Root
    panels={[
      { id: 'a', minSize: 20 },
      { id: 'b', minSize: 40 },
      { id: 'c', minSize: 20 },
    ]}
    defaultSize={[20, 60, 20]}
  >
    <Splitter.Panel id="a">A</Splitter.Panel>
    <Splitter.ResizeTrigger id="a:b" aria-label="Resize" />
    <Splitter.Panel id="b">B</Splitter.Panel>
    <Splitter.ResizeTrigger id="b:c" aria-label="Resize" />
    <Splitter.Panel id="c">C</Splitter.Panel>
  </Splitter.Root>
)
```

### Using the Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the splitter. It accepts the value of the `useSplitter` hook. You
can leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the splitter.

```tsx
import { Splitter, useSplitter } from '@ark-ui/solid/splitter'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const splitter = useSplitter({ defaultSize: [50, 50], panels: [{ id: 'a' }, { id: 'b' }] })

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => splitter().setSizes([100, 0])}>Maximize a</button>

      <Splitter.RootProvider value={splitter}>
        <Splitter.Panel id="a">A</Splitter.Panel>
        <Splitter.ResizeTrigger id="a:b" aria-label="Resize" />
        <Splitter.Panel id="b">B</Splitter.Panel>
      </Splitter.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

# Steps



## Usage

The `Steps` component is used to guide users through a series of steps in a process.

- Supports horizontal and vertical orientations.
- Support for changing the active step with the keyboard and pointer.
- Support for linear and non-linear steps.

```jsx
import { Steps } from '@ark-ui/react/steps'
```

## Examples

### Basic

Here's a basic example of the `Steps` component.

```tsx
import { Steps } from '@ark-ui/solid/steps'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

const items = [
  { value: 'first', title: 'First', description: 'Contact Info' },
  { value: 'second', title: 'Second', description: 'Date & Time' },
  { value: 'third', title: 'Third', description: 'Select Rooms' },
]

export const Basic = () => {
  return (
    <Steps.Root count={items.length}>
      <Steps.List>
        <For each={items}>
          {(item, index) => (
            <Steps.Item index={index()}>
              <Steps.Trigger>
                <Steps.Indicator>{index() + 1}</Steps.Indicator>
                <span>{item.title}</span>
              </Steps.Trigger>
              <Steps.Separator />
            </Steps.Item>
          )}
        </For>
      </Steps.List>

      <For each={items}>
        {(item, index) => (
          <Steps.Content index={index()}>
            {item.title} - {item.description}
          </Steps.Content>
        )}
      </For>

      <Steps.CompletedContent>Steps Complete - Thank you for filling out the form!</Steps.CompletedContent>

      <div>
        <Steps.PrevTrigger>Back</Steps.PrevTrigger>
        <Steps.NextTrigger>Next</Steps.NextTrigger>
      </div>
    </Steps.Root>
  )
}
```

### Controlled Steps

Using the `RootProvider` component, you can control the active step by using the `step` prop and handling the
`onStepChange` event.

```tsx
import { Steps } from '@ark-ui/solid/steps'
import { For, createSignal } from 'solid-js'

const items = [
  { value: 'first', title: 'First', description: 'Contact Info' },
  { value: 'second', title: 'Second', description: 'Date & Time' },
  { value: 'third', title: 'Third', description: 'Select Rooms' },
]

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [step, setStep] = createSignal(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <strong>Current Step:</strong> {step()}
        <button onClick={() => setStep(0)}>Reset to First</button>
        <button onClick={() => setStep(items.length - 1)}>Skip to Last</button>
      </div>

      <Steps.Root count={items.length} step={step()} onStepChange={(details) => setStep(details.step)}>
        <Steps.List>
          <For each={items}>
            {(item, index) => (
              <Steps.Item index={index()}>
                <Steps.Trigger>
                  <Steps.Indicator>{index() + 1}</Steps.Indicator>
                  <span>{item.title}</span>
                </Steps.Trigger>
                <Steps.Separator />
              </Steps.Item>
            )}
          </For>
        </Steps.List>

        <For each={items}>
          {(item, index) => (
            <Steps.Content index={index()}>
              {item.title} - {item.description}
            </Steps.Content>
          )}
        </For>

        <Steps.CompletedContent>Steps Complete - Thank you for filling out the form!</Steps.CompletedContent>

        <div>
          <Steps.PrevTrigger>Back</Steps.PrevTrigger>
          <Steps.NextTrigger>Next</Steps.NextTrigger>
        </div>
      </Steps.Root>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the steps is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useSteps` store hook.

This way you can access the steps state and methods from outside the steps.

```tsx
import { Steps, useSteps } from '@ark-ui/solid/steps'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

const items = [
  { value: 'first', title: 'First', description: 'Contact Info' },
  { value: 'second', title: 'Second', description: 'Date & Time' },
  { value: 'third', title: 'Third', description: 'Select Rooms' },
]

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const steps = useSteps({ count: items.length })

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => steps().resetStep()}>Reset</button>

      <Steps.RootProvider value={steps}>
        <Steps.List>
          <For each={items}>
            {(item, index) => (
              <Steps.Item index={index()}>
                <Steps.Trigger>
                  <Steps.Indicator>{index() + 1}</Steps.Indicator>
                  <span>{item.title}</span>
                </Steps.Trigger>
                <Steps.Separator />
              </Steps.Item>
            )}
          </For>
        </Steps.List>

        <For each={items}>
          {(item, index) => (
            <Steps.Content index={index()}>
              {item.title} - {item.description}
            </Steps.Content>
          )}
        </For>

        <Steps.CompletedContent>Steps Complete - Thank you for filling out the form!</Steps.CompletedContent>

        <div>
          <Steps.PrevTrigger>Back</Steps.PrevTrigger>
          <Steps.NextTrigger>Next</Steps.NextTrigger>
        </div>
      </Steps.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

# Switch



## Anatomy

To set up the switch correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



### Design impact on the asChild property

The `Switch.Root` element of the switch is a `label` element. This is because the switch is a form control and should be
associated with a label to provide context and meaning to the user. Otherwise, the HTML and accessibility structure will
be invalid.

> If you need to use the `asChild` property, make sure that the `label` element is the direct child of the `Switch.Root`
> component.

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Switch` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

```tsx
import { Switch } from '@ark-ui/solid/switch'

export const Basic = () => (
  <Switch.Root>
    <Switch.Control>
      <Switch.Thumb />
    </Switch.Control>
    <Switch.Label>Label</Switch.Label>
    <Switch.HiddenInput />
  </Switch.Root>
)
```

### Controlled Switch

For a controlled Switch component, the state of the toggle is managed using the checked prop, and updates when the
`onCheckedChange` event handler is called:

```tsx
import { Switch } from '@ark-ui/solid/switch'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [checked, setChecked] = createSignal(false)

  return (
    <Switch.Root checked={checked()} onCheckedChange={(e) => setChecked(e.checked)}>
      <Switch.Control>
        <Switch.Thumb />
      </Switch.Control>
      <Switch.Label>Label</Switch.Label>
      <Switch.HiddenInput />
    </Switch.Root>
  )
}
```

### Render Prop Usage

The Switch component also allows for a render prop, granting direct access to its internal state. This enables you to
dynamically adjust and customize aspects of the component based on its current state:

```tsx
import { Switch } from '@ark-ui/solid/switch'

export const RenderProp = () => (
  <Switch.Root>
    <Switch.Control>
      <Switch.Thumb />
    </Switch.Control>
    <Switch.Context>
      {(context) => <Switch.Label>Feature is {context().checked ? 'enabled' : 'disabled'}</Switch.Label>}
    </Switch.Context>
    <Switch.HiddenInput />
  </Switch.Root>
)
```

### Using the Field Component

The `Field` component helps manage form-related state and accessibility attributes of a switch. It includes handling
ARIA labels, helper text, and error text to ensure proper accessibility.

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'
import { Switch } from '@ark-ui/solid/switch'

export const WithField = (props: Field.RootProps) => (
  <Field.Root {...props}>
    <Switch.Root>
      <Switch.Control>
        <Switch.Thumb />
      </Switch.Control>
      <Switch.Label>Label</Switch.Label>
      <Switch.HiddenInput />
    </Switch.Root>
    <Field.HelperText>Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
    <Field.ErrorText>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
  </Field.Root>
)
```

### Using the Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the switch. It accepts the value of the `useSwitch` hook. You can
leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the switch.

```tsx
import { Switch, useSwitch } from '@ark-ui/solid/switch'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const switchApi = useSwitch()

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => switchApi().toggleChecked()}>Toggle</button>

      <Switch.RootProvider value={switchApi}>
        <Switch.Control>
          <Switch.Thumb />
        </Switch.Control>
        <Switch.Label>Label</Switch.Label>
        <Switch.HiddenInput />
      </Switch.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

# Tabs



## Anatomy

To set up the tabs correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



## Examples

Learn how to use the `Tabs` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

```tsx
import { Tabs } from '@ark-ui/solid/tabs'

export const Basic = () => (
  <Tabs.Root>
    <Tabs.List>
      <Tabs.Trigger value="react">React</Tabs.Trigger>
      <Tabs.Trigger value="vue">Vue</Tabs.Trigger>
      <Tabs.Trigger value="solid">Solid</Tabs.Trigger>
    </Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Content value="react">React Content</Tabs.Content>
    <Tabs.Content value="vue">Vue Content</Tabs.Content>
    <Tabs.Content value="solid">Solid Content</Tabs.Content>
  </Tabs.Root>
)
```

### Initial Tab

To set a default tab on initial render, use the `defaultValue` prop:

```tsx
import { Tabs } from '@ark-ui/solid/tabs'

export const InitialTab = () => (
  <Tabs.Root value="react">
    <Tabs.List>
      <Tabs.Trigger value="react">React</Tabs.Trigger>
      <Tabs.Trigger value="vue">Vue</Tabs.Trigger>
      <Tabs.Trigger value="solid">Solid</Tabs.Trigger>
    </Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Content value="react">React Content</Tabs.Content>
    <Tabs.Content value="vue">Vue Content</Tabs.Content>
    <Tabs.Content value="solid">Solid Content</Tabs.Content>
  </Tabs.Root>
)
```

### Tab Indicator

To provide a visual cue for the selected tab, use the `Tabs.Indicator` component:

```tsx
import { Tabs } from '@ark-ui/solid/tabs'

export const Indicator = () => (
  <Tabs.Root>
    <Tabs.List>
      <Tabs.Trigger value="react">React</Tabs.Trigger>
      <Tabs.Trigger value="vue">Vue</Tabs.Trigger>
      <Tabs.Trigger value="solid">Solid</Tabs.Trigger>
      <Tabs.Indicator />
    </Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Content value="react">React Content</Tabs.Content>
    <Tabs.Content value="vue">Vue Content</Tabs.Content>
    <Tabs.Content value="solid">Solid Content</Tabs.Content>
  </Tabs.Root>
)
```

### Lazy Mounting

Lazy mounting is a feature that allows the content of a tab to be rendered only when the tab is first activated. This is
useful for performance optimization, especially when tab content is large or complex. To enable lazy mounting, use the
`lazyMount` prop on the `Tabs.Content` component.

In addition, the `unmountOnExit` prop can be used in conjunction with `lazyMount` to unmount the tab content when the
tab is deactivated, freeing up resources. The next time the tab is activated, its content will be re-rendered.

```tsx
import { Tabs } from '@ark-ui/solid/tabs'

export const LazyMount = () => (
  <Tabs.Root lazyMount unmountOnExit>
    <Tabs.List>
      <Tabs.Trigger value="react">React</Tabs.Trigger>
      <Tabs.Trigger value="vue">Vue</Tabs.Trigger>
      <Tabs.Trigger value="solid">Solid</Tabs.Trigger>
      <Tabs.Indicator />
    </Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Content value="react">React Content</Tabs.Content>
    <Tabs.Content value="vue">Vue Content</Tabs.Content>
    <Tabs.Content value="solid">Solid Content</Tabs.Content>
  </Tabs.Root>
)
```

### Disabled Tab

To disable a tab, simply pass the `disabled` prop to the `Tabs.Trigger` component:

```tsx
import { Tabs } from '@ark-ui/solid/tabs'

export const DisabledTab = () => (
  <Tabs.Root value="react">
    <Tabs.List>
      <Tabs.Trigger value="react">React</Tabs.Trigger>
      <Tabs.Trigger value="vue" disabled>
        Vue
      </Tabs.Trigger>
      <Tabs.Trigger value="solid">Solid</Tabs.Trigger>
    </Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Content value="react">React Content</Tabs.Content>
    <Tabs.Content value="vue">Vue Content</Tabs.Content>
    <Tabs.Content value="solid">Solid Content</Tabs.Content>
  </Tabs.Root>
)
```

### Controlled Tabs

To create a controlled Tabs component, manage the current selected tab using the `value` prop and update it when the
`onValueChange` event handler is called:

```tsx
import { Tabs } from '@ark-ui/solid/tabs'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = createSignal<string | null>('react')
  return (
    <Tabs.Root value={value()} onValueChange={(e) => setValue(e.value)}>
      <Tabs.List>
        <Tabs.Trigger value="react">React</Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.Trigger value="vue">Vue</Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.Trigger value="solid">Solid</Tabs.Trigger>
      </Tabs.List>
      <Tabs.Content value="react">React Content</Tabs.Content>
      <Tabs.Content value="vue">Vue Content</Tabs.Content>
      <Tabs.Content value="solid">Solid Content</Tabs.Content>
    </Tabs.Root>
  )
}
```

### Router Controlled Tabs

When using frameworks like Next.js, Remix, or React Router, controlling the active tabs based on the URL can be useful.

To achieve this, you need to do two things:

- Set the `value` prop to the current URL path.
- Listen to the `onValueChange` event and update the URL path.

Here's an example using Remix Router

```tsx
import { Tabs } from '@ark-ui/react/tabs'
import { useLocation, useNavigate, Link } from '@remix-run/react'

export default function App() {
  const { pathname } = useLocation()
  const navigate = useNavigate()
  const lastPathFragment = pathname.substring(pathname.lastIndexOf('/') + 1)
  const activeTab = lastPathFragment.length > 0 ? lastPathFragment : 'homepage'

  return (
    <Tabs.Root
      value={activeTab}
      onValueChange={({ value }) => {
        navigate(`/${value === 'home' ? '' : value}`)
      }}
    >
      <Tabs.List>
        <Tabs.Trigger asChild value="home">
          <Link to="">Home</Link>
        </Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.Trigger asChild value="page-1">
          <Link to="page-1">Page 1</Link>
        </Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.Trigger asChild value="page-2">
          <Link to="page-2">Page 2</Link>
        </Tabs.Trigger>
      </Tabs.List>
    </Tabs.Root>
  )
}
```

### Vertical Tabs

The default orientation of the tabs is `horizontal`. To change the orientation, set the `orientation` prop to
`vertical`.

```tsx
import { Tabs } from '@ark-ui/solid/tabs'

export const Vertical = () => (
  <Tabs.Root orientation="vertical" value="react">
    <Tabs.List>
      <Tabs.Trigger value="react">React</Tabs.Trigger>
      <Tabs.Trigger value="vue">Vue</Tabs.Trigger>
      <Tabs.Trigger value="solid">Solid</Tabs.Trigger>
    </Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Content value="react">React Content</Tabs.Content>
    <Tabs.Content value="vue">Vue Content</Tabs.Content>
    <Tabs.Content value="solid">Solid Content</Tabs.Content>
  </Tabs.Root>
)
```

### Manual Activation

By default, the tab can be selected when it receives focus from either the keyboard or pointer interaction. This is
called automatic tab activation.

In contrast, manual tab activation means the tab is selected with the

<kbd>Enter</kbd> key or by clicking on the tab.

```tsx
import { Tabs } from '@ark-ui/solid/tabs'

export const Manual = () => (
  <Tabs.Root activationMode="manual" value="react">
    <Tabs.List>
      <Tabs.Trigger value="react">React</Tabs.Trigger>
      <Tabs.Trigger value="vue">Vue</Tabs.Trigger>
      <Tabs.Trigger value="solid">Solid</Tabs.Trigger>
    </Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Content value="react">React Content</Tabs.Content>
    <Tabs.Content value="vue">Vue Content</Tabs.Content>
    <Tabs.Content value="solid">Solid Content</Tabs.Content>
  </Tabs.Root>
)
```

### Using the Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the tabs. It accepts the value of the `useTabs` hook. You can
leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the tabs.

```tsx
import { Tabs, useTabs } from '@ark-ui/solid/tabs'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const tabs = useTabs()

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => tabs().focus()}>Focus</button>

      <Tabs.RootProvider value={tabs}>
        <Tabs.List>
          <Tabs.Trigger value="react">React</Tabs.Trigger>
          <Tabs.Trigger value="vue">Vue</Tabs.Trigger>
          <Tabs.Trigger value="solid">Solid</Tabs.Trigger>
        </Tabs.List>
        <Tabs.Content value="react">React Content</Tabs.Content>
        <Tabs.Content value="vue">Vue Content</Tabs.Content>
        <Tabs.Content value="solid">Solid Content</Tabs.Content>
      </Tabs.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

# Tags Input



## Anatomy

To set up the tags input correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



## Examples

Learn how to use the `TagsInput` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

```tsx
import { TagsInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const Basic = () => (
  <TagsInput.Root>
    <TagsInput.Context>
      {(api) => (
        <>
          <TagsInput.Label>Frameworks</TagsInput.Label>
          <TagsInput.Control>
            <Index each={api().value}>
              {(value, index) => (
                <TagsInput.Item index={index} value={value()}>
                  <TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                    <TagsInput.ItemText>{value()}</TagsInput.ItemText>
                    <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                      <XIcon />
                    </TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                  </TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                  <TagsInput.ItemInput />
                </TagsInput.Item>
              )}
            </Index>
            <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Add Framework" />
            <TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
              <XIcon />
            </TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
          </TagsInput.Control>
        </>
      )}
    </TagsInput.Context>
    <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
  </TagsInput.Root>
)
```

### Initial tags

To set the initial tag values, set the `defaultValue` prop.

```tsx
import { TagsInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const InitialValue = () => {
  return (
    <TagsInput.Root value={['React', 'Solid', 'Vue', 'Svelte']}>
      <TagsInput.Context>
        {(api) => (
          <>
            <TagsInput.Label>Frameworks</TagsInput.Label>
            <TagsInput.Control>
              <Index each={api().value}>
                {(value, index) => (
                  <TagsInput.Item index={index} value={value()}>
                    <TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                      <TagsInput.ItemText>{value()}</TagsInput.ItemText>
                      <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                        <XIcon />
                      </TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                    </TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                    <TagsInput.ItemInput />
                  </TagsInput.Item>
                )}
              </Index>
              <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Add tag" />
              <TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
                <XIcon />
              </TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
            </TagsInput.Control>
          </>
        )}
      </TagsInput.Context>
      <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
    </TagsInput.Root>
  )
}
```

### Max Tags

To limit the number of tags within the component, you can set the `max` property to the limit you want. The default
value is `Infinity`.

When the tag reaches the limit, new tags cannot be added except the `allowOverflow` prop is set to `true`.

```tsx
import { TagsInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const MaxWithOverflow = () => {
  return (
    <TagsInput.Root max={3} allowOverflow>
      <TagsInput.Context>
        {(api) => (
          <>
            <TagsInput.Label>Frameworks</TagsInput.Label>
            <TagsInput.Control>
              <Index each={api().value}>
                {(value, index) => (
                  <TagsInput.Item index={index} value={value()}>
                    <TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                      <TagsInput.ItemText>{value()}</TagsInput.ItemText>
                      <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                        <XIcon />
                      </TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                    </TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                    <TagsInput.ItemInput />
                  </TagsInput.Item>
                )}
              </Index>
              <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Add Framework" />
              <TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
                <XIcon />
              </TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
            </TagsInput.Control>
          </>
        )}
      </TagsInput.Context>
      <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
    </TagsInput.Root>
  )
}
```

### Controlled

Use the `value` and `onValueChange` props to programmatically control the tags input's state. This allows you to manage
the tags array externally and respond to changes.

```tsx
import { TagsInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index, createSignal } from 'solid-js'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = createSignal<string[]>(['vue', 'react'])

  return (
    <>
      <p>Values: {value().join(', ')}</p>
      <TagsInput.Root value={value()} onValueChange={(details) => setValue(details.value)}>
        <TagsInput.Context>
          {(api) => (
            <>
              <TagsInput.Label>Frameworks</TagsInput.Label>
              <TagsInput.Control>
                <Index each={api().value}>
                  {(value, index) => (
                    <TagsInput.Item index={index} value={value()}>
                      <TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                        <TagsInput.ItemText>{value()}</TagsInput.ItemText>
                        <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                          <XIcon />
                        </TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                      </TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                      <TagsInput.ItemInput />
                    </TagsInput.Item>
                  )}
                </Index>
                <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Add Framework" />
                <TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
                  <XIcon />
                </TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
              </TagsInput.Control>
            </>
          )}
        </TagsInput.Context>
        <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
      </TagsInput.Root>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Controlled Input Value

Use the `inputValue` and `onInputValueChange` props to control the text input field independently. This is useful for
clearing the input or pre-filling it programmatically.

```tsx
import { TagsInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index, createSignal } from 'solid-js'

export const ControlledInputValue = () => {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = createSignal('')

  return (
    <div>
      <div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '8px', 'margin-bottom': '12px' }}>
        <button type="button" onClick={() => setInputValue('React')}>
          Set to "React"
        </button>
        <button type="button" onClick={() => setInputValue('')}>
          Clear Input
        </button>
        <span style={{ 'font-size': '14px', 'margin-left': '8px' }}>Current input: "{inputValue()}"</span>
      </div>

      <TagsInput.Root inputValue={inputValue()} onInputValueChange={(details) => setInputValue(details.inputValue)}>
        <TagsInput.Context>
          {(api) => (
            <>
              <TagsInput.Label>Frameworks</TagsInput.Label>
              <TagsInput.Control>
                <Index each={api().value}>
                  {(value, index) => (
                    <TagsInput.Item index={index} value={value()}>
                      <TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                        <TagsInput.ItemText>{value()}</TagsInput.ItemText>
                        <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                          <XIcon />
                        </TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                      </TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                      <TagsInput.ItemInput />
                    </TagsInput.Item>
                  )}
                </Index>
                <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Add Framework" />
                <TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
                  <XIcon />
                </TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
              </TagsInput.Control>
            </>
          )}
        </TagsInput.Context>
        <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
      </TagsInput.Root>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Custom Delimiter

Use the `delimiter` prop with a regex pattern to specify multiple characters that can separate tags. By default, only
the Enter key creates tags.

```tsx
import { TagsInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

const DELIMITER_PATTERN = /[,;\s]/

export const Delimiter = () => (
  <TagsInput.Root delimiter={DELIMITER_PATTERN}>
    <TagsInput.Context>
      {(api) => (
        <>
          <TagsInput.Label>Frameworks (separate with comma, semicolon, or space)</TagsInput.Label>
          <TagsInput.Control>
            <Index each={api().value}>
              {(value, index) => (
                <TagsInput.Item index={index} value={value()}>
                  <TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                    <TagsInput.ItemText>{value()}</TagsInput.ItemText>
                    <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                      <XIcon />
                    </TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                  </TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                  <TagsInput.ItemInput />
                </TagsInput.Item>
              )}
            </Index>
            <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Type and use comma, semicolon, or space" />
            <TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
              <XIcon />
            </TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
          </TagsInput.Control>
        </>
      )}
    </TagsInput.Context>
    <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
  </TagsInput.Root>
)
```

### Disabled

Use the `disabled` prop to make the tags input non-interactive. Users won't be able to add, remove, or edit tags.

```tsx
import { TagsInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const Disabled = () => (
  <TagsInput.Root defaultValue={['React', 'Solid', 'Vue']} disabled>
    <TagsInput.Context>
      {(api) => (
        <>
          <TagsInput.Label>Frameworks (Disabled)</TagsInput.Label>
          <TagsInput.Control>
            <Index each={api().value}>
              {(value, index) => (
                <TagsInput.Item index={index} value={value()}>
                  <TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                    <TagsInput.ItemText>{value()}</TagsInput.ItemText>
                    <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                      <XIcon />
                    </TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                  </TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                  <TagsInput.ItemInput />
                </TagsInput.Item>
              )}
            </Index>
            <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Cannot interact when disabled" />
            <TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
              <XIcon />
            </TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
          </TagsInput.Control>
        </>
      )}
    </TagsInput.Context>
    <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
  </TagsInput.Root>
)
```

### Invalid

Use the `invalid` prop to mark the tags input as invalid for form validation purposes.

```tsx
import { TagsInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const Invalid = () => (
  <TagsInput.Root invalid>
    <TagsInput.Context>
      {(api) => (
        <>
          <TagsInput.Label>Frameworks</TagsInput.Label>
          <TagsInput.Control>
            <Index each={api().value}>
              {(value, index) => (
                <TagsInput.Item index={index} value={value()}>
                  <TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                    <TagsInput.ItemText>{value()}</TagsInput.ItemText>
                    <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                      <XIcon />
                    </TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                  </TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                  <TagsInput.ItemInput />
                </TagsInput.Item>
              )}
            </Index>
            <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Add Framework" />
            <TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
              <XIcon />
            </TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
          </TagsInput.Control>
        </>
      )}
    </TagsInput.Context>
    <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
  </TagsInput.Root>
)
```

### Max Tag Length

Use the `maxLength` prop to limit the number of characters allowed per tag. This prevents users from creating overly
long tags.

```tsx
import { TagsInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const MaxTagLength = () => (
  <TagsInput.Root maxLength={10}>
    <TagsInput.Context>
      {(api) => (
        <>
          <TagsInput.Label>Frameworks (max 10 characters per tag)</TagsInput.Label>
          <TagsInput.Control>
            <Index each={api().value}>
              {(value, index) => (
                <TagsInput.Item index={index} value={value()}>
                  <TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                    <TagsInput.ItemText>{value()}</TagsInput.ItemText>
                    <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                      <XIcon />
                    </TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                  </TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                  <TagsInput.ItemInput />
                </TagsInput.Item>
              )}
            </Index>
            <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Max 10 characters" />
            <TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
              <XIcon />
            </TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
          </TagsInput.Control>
        </>
      )}
    </TagsInput.Context>
    <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
  </TagsInput.Root>
)
```

### Programmatic Control

Use the `useTagsInput` hook with `RootProvider` to access the component's API methods like `addValue()`, `setValue()`,
and `clearValue()` for full programmatic control.

```tsx
import { TagsInput, useTagsInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const ProgrammaticControl = () => {
  const tagsInput = useTagsInput()

  return (
    <>
      <div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '8px', 'margin-bottom': '12px' }}>
        <button type="button" onClick={() => tagsInput().addValue('React')}>
          Add React
        </button>
        <button type="button" onClick={() => tagsInput().addValue('Solid')}>
          Add Solid
        </button>
        <button type="button" onClick={() => tagsInput().setValue(['Vue', 'Svelte'])}>
          Set to Vue & Svelte
        </button>
        <button type="button" onClick={() => tagsInput().clearValue()}>
          Clear All
        </button>
      </div>

      <TagsInput.RootProvider value={tagsInput}>
        <TagsInput.Context>
          {(api) => (
            <>
              <TagsInput.Label>Frameworks (Programmatic Control)</TagsInput.Label>
              <TagsInput.Control>
                <Index each={api().value}>
                  {(value, index) => (
                    <TagsInput.Item index={index} value={value()}>
                      <TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                        <TagsInput.ItemText>{value()}</TagsInput.ItemText>
                        <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                          <XIcon />
                        </TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                      </TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                      <TagsInput.ItemInput />
                    </TagsInput.Item>
                  )}
                </Index>
                <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Add Framework" />
                <TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
                  <XIcon />
                </TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
              </TagsInput.Control>
            </>
          )}
        </TagsInput.Context>
        <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
      </TagsInput.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Read-only

Use the `readOnly` prop to make tags visible but not editable. Users can view tags but cannot add, remove, or modify
them.

```tsx
import { TagsInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const Readonly = () => (
  <TagsInput.Root defaultValue={['React', 'Solid', 'Vue']} readOnly>
    <TagsInput.Context>
      {(api) => (
        <>
          <TagsInput.Label>Frameworks (Read-only)</TagsInput.Label>
          <TagsInput.Control>
            <Index each={api().value}>
              {(value, index) => (
                <TagsInput.Item index={index} value={value()}>
                  <TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                    <TagsInput.ItemText>{value()}</TagsInput.ItemText>
                    <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                      <XIcon />
                    </TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                  </TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                  <TagsInput.ItemInput />
                </TagsInput.Item>
              )}
            </Index>
            <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Cannot add tags in read-only mode" />
            <TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
              <XIcon />
            </TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
          </TagsInput.Control>
        </>
      )}
    </TagsInput.Context>
    <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
  </TagsInput.Root>
)
```

### Validating Tags

Before a tag is added, the `validate` function is called to determine whether to accept or reject a tag.

A common use-case for validating tags is preventing duplicates or validating the data type.

```tsx
import { TagsInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const Validation = () => {
  return (
    <TagsInput.Root
      validate={(details) => {
        return !details.value.includes(details.inputValue)
      }}
    >
      <TagsInput.Context>
        {(api) => (
          <>
            <TagsInput.Label>Frameworks</TagsInput.Label>
            <TagsInput.Control>
              <Index each={api().value}>
                {(value, index) => (
                  <TagsInput.Item index={index} value={value()}>
                    <TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                      <TagsInput.ItemText>{value()}</TagsInput.ItemText>
                      <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                        <XIcon />
                      </TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                    </TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                    <TagsInput.ItemInput />
                  </TagsInput.Item>
                )}
              </Index>
              <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Add Framework" />
              <TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
                <XIcon />
              </TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
            </TagsInput.Control>
          </>
        )}
      </TagsInput.Context>
      <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
    </TagsInput.Root>
  )
}
```

### Blur behavior

When the tags input is blurred, you can configure the action the component should take by passing the `blurBehavior`
prop.

- `add` — Adds the tag to the list of tags.
- `clear` — Clears the tags input value.

```tsx
import { TagsInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const BlurBehavior = () => {
  return (
    <TagsInput.Root blurBehavior="add">
      <TagsInput.Context>
        {(api) => (
          <>
            <TagsInput.Label>Frameworks</TagsInput.Label>
            <TagsInput.Control>
              <Index each={api().value}>
                {(value, index) => (
                  <TagsInput.Item index={index} value={value()}>
                    <TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                      <TagsInput.ItemText>{value()}</TagsInput.ItemText>
                      <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                        <XIcon />
                      </TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                    </TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                    <TagsInput.ItemInput />
                  </TagsInput.Item>
                )}
              </Index>
              <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Add Framework" />
              <TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
                <XIcon />
              </TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
            </TagsInput.Control>
          </>
        )}
      </TagsInput.Context>
      <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
    </TagsInput.Root>
  )
}
```

### Paste behavior

To add a tag when a arbitrary value is pasted in the input element, pass the `addOnPaste` prop.

When a value is pasted, the component will:

- check if the value is a valid tag based on the `validate` option
- split the value by the `delimiter` option passed

```tsx
import { TagsInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const PasteBehavior = () => {
  return (
    <TagsInput.Root addOnPaste delimiter=",">
      <TagsInput.Context>
        {(api) => (
          <>
            <TagsInput.Label>Frameworks</TagsInput.Label>
            <TagsInput.Control>
              <Index each={api().value}>
                {(value, index) => (
                  <TagsInput.Item index={index} value={value()}>
                    <TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                      <TagsInput.ItemText>{value()}</TagsInput.ItemText>
                      <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                        <XIcon />
                      </TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                    </TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                    <TagsInput.ItemInput />
                  </TagsInput.Item>
                )}
              </Index>
              <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Add Framework" />
              <TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
                <XIcon />
              </TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
            </TagsInput.Control>
          </>
        )}
      </TagsInput.Context>
      <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
    </TagsInput.Root>
  )
}
```

### Disable tag editing

by default the tags can be edited by double-clicking on the tag or focusing on them and pressing

<kbd>Enter</kbd>. To disable this behavior, pass `editable={false}`

```tsx
import { TagsInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const DisabledEditing = () => {
  return (
    <TagsInput.Root editable={false}>
      <TagsInput.Context>
        {(api) => (
          <>
            <TagsInput.Label>Frameworks</TagsInput.Label>
            <TagsInput.Control>
              <Index each={api().value}>
                {(value, index) => (
                  <TagsInput.Item index={index} value={value()}>
                    <TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                      <TagsInput.ItemText>{value()}</TagsInput.ItemText>
                      <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                        <XIcon />
                      </TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                    </TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                    <TagsInput.ItemInput />
                  </TagsInput.Item>
                )}
              </Index>
              <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Add Framework" />
              <TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
                <XIcon />
              </TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
            </TagsInput.Control>
          </>
        )}
      </TagsInput.Context>
      <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
    </TagsInput.Root>
  )
}
```

### Events

During the lifetime of the tags input interaction, here's a list of events we emit:

- `onValueChange` — invoked when the tag value changes.
- `onHighlightChange` — invoked when a tag has visual focus.
- `onValueInvalid` — invoked when the max tag count is reached or the `validate` function returns `false`.

```tsx
import { TagsInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const OnEvent = () => {
  return (
    <TagsInput.Root
      onValueChange={(details) => {
        console.log('tags changed to:', details.value)
      }}
      onHighlightChange={(details) => {
        console.log('highlighted tag:', details.highlightedValue)
      }}
      onValueInvalid={(details) => {
        console.log('Invalid!', details.reason)
      }}
      max={3}
      allowOverflow
      validate={(details) => {
        return !details.value.includes(details.inputValue)
      }}
    >
      <TagsInput.Context>
        {(api) => (
          <>
            <TagsInput.Label>Frameworks</TagsInput.Label>
            <TagsInput.Control>
              <Index each={api().value}>
                {(value, index) => (
                  <TagsInput.Item index={index} value={value()}>
                    <TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                      <TagsInput.ItemText>{value()}</TagsInput.ItemText>
                      <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                        <XIcon />
                      </TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                    </TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                    <TagsInput.ItemInput />
                  </TagsInput.Item>
                )}
              </Index>
              <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Add Framework" />
              <TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
                <XIcon />
              </TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
            </TagsInput.Control>
          </>
        )}
      </TagsInput.Context>
      <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
    </TagsInput.Root>
  )
}
```

### Using the Field Component

The `Field` component helps manage form-related state and accessibility attributes of a tags input. It includes handling
ARIA labels, helper text, and error text to ensure proper accessibility.

```tsx
import { Field } from '@ark-ui/solid/field'
import { TagsInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const WithField = (props: Field.RootProps) => {
  return (
    <Field.Root {...props}>
      <TagsInput.Root>
        <TagsInput.Context>
          {(tagsInput) => (
            <>
              <TagsInput.Label>Label</TagsInput.Label>
              <TagsInput.Control>
                <Index each={tagsInput().value}>
                  {(value, index) => (
                    <TagsInput.Item index={index} value={value()}>
                      <TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                        <TagsInput.ItemText>{value()}</TagsInput.ItemText>
                        <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                          <XIcon />
                        </TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                      </TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                      <TagsInput.ItemInput />
                    </TagsInput.Item>
                  )}
                </Index>
                <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Add Framework" />
                <TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
                  <XIcon />
                </TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
              </TagsInput.Control>
            </>
          )}
        </TagsInput.Context>
        <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
      </TagsInput.Root>
      <Field.HelperText>Additional Info</Field.HelperText>
      <Field.ErrorText>Error Info</Field.ErrorText>
    </Field.Root>
  )
}
```

### Using the Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the tags-input. It accepts the value of the `useTags-input` hook.
You can leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the tags-input.

```tsx
import { TagsInput, useTagsInput } from '@ark-ui/solid/tags-input'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Index } from 'solid-js'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const tagsInput = useTagsInput()

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => tagsInput().focus()}>Focus</button>

      <TagsInput.RootProvider value={tagsInput}>
        <TagsInput.Context>
          {(api) => (
            <>
              <TagsInput.Label>Frameworks</TagsInput.Label>
              <TagsInput.Control>
                <Index each={api().value}>
                  {(value, index) => (
                    <TagsInput.Item index={index} value={value()}>
                      <TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                        <TagsInput.ItemText>{value()}</TagsInput.ItemText>
                        <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                          <XIcon />
                        </TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
                      </TagsInput.ItemPreview>
                      <TagsInput.ItemInput />
                    </TagsInput.Item>
                  )}
                </Index>
                <TagsInput.Input placeholder="Add Framework" />
                <TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
                  <XIcon />
                </TagsInput.ClearTrigger>
              </TagsInput.Control>
            </>
          )}
        </TagsInput.Context>
        <TagsInput.HiddenInput />
      </TagsInput.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

## Guides

### Navigating and Editing tags

When the input has an empty value or the caret is at the start position, the tags can be selected by using the arrow
left and arrow right keys. When "visual" focus in on any tag:

- Pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> or double-clicking on the tag will put it in edit mode, allowing the user change its value
  and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to commit the changes.
- Pressing <kbd>Delete</kbd> or <kbd>Backspace</kbd> will delete the tag that has _visual_ focus.

# Timer



## Examples

Learn how to use the `Timer` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

```tsx
import { Timer } from '@ark-ui/solid/timer'

export const Basic = () => (
  <Timer.Root targetMs={60 * 60 * 1000}>
    <Timer.Area>
      <Timer.Item type="days" />
      <Timer.Separator>:</Timer.Separator>
      <Timer.Item type="hours" />
      <Timer.Separator>:</Timer.Separator>
      <Timer.Item type="minutes" />
      <Timer.Separator>:</Timer.Separator>
      <Timer.Item type="seconds" />
    </Timer.Area>
    <Timer.Control>
      <Timer.ActionTrigger action="start">Play</Timer.ActionTrigger>
      <Timer.ActionTrigger action="resume">Resume</Timer.ActionTrigger>
      <Timer.ActionTrigger action="pause">Pause</Timer.ActionTrigger>
    </Timer.Control>
  </Timer.Root>
)
```

### Countdown Timer

You can create a countdown timer by setting the `targetMs` prop to a future timestamp:

```tsx
import { Timer } from '@ark-ui/solid/timer'

export const Countdown = () => (
  <Timer.Root autoStart countdown startMs={60 * 60 * 500}>
    <Timer.Area>
      <Timer.Item type="days" />
      <Timer.Separator>:</Timer.Separator>
      <Timer.Item type="hours" />
      <Timer.Separator>:</Timer.Separator>
      <Timer.Item type="minutes" />
      <Timer.Separator>:</Timer.Separator>
      <Timer.Item type="seconds" />
    </Timer.Area>
  </Timer.Root>
)
```

### Timer Events

The Timer component provides events that you can listen to for various timer-related actions.

- The `onComplete` event is triggered when the timer reaches its target time.
- The `onTick` event is called on each timer update, providing details about the current timer state.

```tsx
import { Timer } from '@ark-ui/solid/timer'

export const Events = () => (
  <Timer.Root
    targetMs={5 * 1000}
    onComplete={() => console.log('Timer completed')}
    onTick={(details) => console.log('Tick:', details.formattedTime)}
  >
    <Timer.Item type="seconds" />
  </Timer.Root>
)
```

### Using the Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the timer. It accepts the value of the `useTimer` hook. You can
leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the timer.

```tsx
import { Timer, useTimer } from '@ark-ui/solid/timer'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const timer = useTimer({ targetMs: 60 * 60 * 1000 })

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => timer().pause()}>Pause</button>

      <Timer.RootProvider value={timer}>
        <Timer.Area>
          <Timer.Item type="days" />
          <Timer.Separator>:</Timer.Separator>
          <Timer.Item type="hours" />
          <Timer.Separator>:</Timer.Separator>
          <Timer.Item type="minutes" />
          <Timer.Separator>:</Timer.Separator>
          <Timer.Item type="seconds" />
        </Timer.Area>
        <Timer.Control>
          <Timer.ActionTrigger action="start">Play</Timer.ActionTrigger>
          <Timer.ActionTrigger action="resume">Resume</Timer.ActionTrigger>
          <Timer.ActionTrigger action="pause">Pause</Timer.ActionTrigger>
        </Timer.Control>
      </Timer.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

# Toast



## Anatomy

To set up the toast correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



## Setup

To use the Toast component, create the toast engine using the `createToaster` function.

This function manages the placement and grouping of toasts, and provides a `toast` object needed to create toast
notification.

```ts
const toaster = createToaster({
  placement: 'bottom-end',
  overlap: true,
  gap: 24,
})
```

## Examples

Here's an example of creating a toast using the `toast.create` method.

```tsx
import { Toast, Toaster, createToaster } from '@ark-ui/solid/toast'
import { XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

export const Basic = () => {
  const toaster = createToaster({
    placement: 'bottom-end',
    gap: 24,
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <button
        type="button"
        onClick={() =>
          toaster.create({
            title: 'Loading!',
            description: 'We are loading something for you. Please wait.',
            type: 'info',
          })
        }
      >
        Add Toast
      </button>
      <Toaster toaster={toaster}>
        {(toast) => (
          <Toast.Root>
            <Toast.Title>{toast().title}</Toast.Title>
            <Toast.Description>{toast().description}</Toast.Description>
            <Toast.CloseTrigger>
              <XIcon />
            </Toast.CloseTrigger>
          </Toast.Root>
        )}
      </Toaster>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Toast Types

You can create different types of toasts (`success`, `error`, `warning`, `info`) with appropriate styling. For example,
to create a success toast, you can do:

```ts
toaster.success({
  title: 'Success!',
  description: 'Your changes have been saved.',
})
```

```tsx
import { Toast, Toaster, createToaster } from '@ark-ui/solid/toast'
import { CircleAlertIcon, TriangleAlertIcon, CircleCheckIcon, InfoIcon, XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Dynamic } from 'solid-js/web'

const iconMap = {
  success: CircleCheckIcon,
  error: CircleAlertIcon,
  warning: TriangleAlertIcon,
  info: InfoIcon,
}

export const Types = () => {
  const toaster = createToaster({
    overlap: true,
    placement: 'bottom-end',
    gap: 16,
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '12px', 'flex-wrap': 'wrap' }}>
        <button
          type="button"
          onClick={() => toaster.success({ title: 'Success!', description: 'Your changes have been saved.' })}
        >
          Success
        </button>
        <button
          type="button"
          onClick={() =>
            toaster.error({ title: 'Error occurred', description: 'Something went wrong. Please try again.' })
          }
        >
          Error
        </button>
        <button
          type="button"
          onClick={() => toaster.warning({ title: 'Warning', description: 'This action cannot be undone.' })}
        >
          Warning
        </button>
        <button
          type="button"
          onClick={() =>
            toaster.info({ title: 'New update available', description: 'Version 2.1.0 is now available for download.' })
          }
        >
          Info
        </button>
      </div>

      <Toaster toaster={toaster}>
        {(toast) => {
          const icon = () => (toast().type ? iconMap[toast().type as keyof typeof iconMap] : InfoIcon)
          return (
            <Toast.Root>
              <div style={{ display: 'flex', 'align-items': 'flex-start', gap: '12px' }}>
                <Dynamic component={icon()} />
                <div style={{ flex: 1 }}>
                  <Toast.Title>{toast().title}</Toast.Title>
                  <Toast.Description>{toast().description}</Toast.Description>
                </div>
                <Toast.CloseTrigger>
                  <XIcon />
                </Toast.CloseTrigger>
              </div>
            </Toast.Root>
          )
        }}
      </Toaster>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Promise

You can use `toaster.promise()` to automatically handle the different states of an asynchronous operation. It provides
options for the `success`, `error`, and `loading` states of the promise and will automatically update the toast when the
promise resolves or rejects.

```tsx
import { Toast, Toaster, createToaster } from '@ark-ui/solid/toast'
import { CircleAlertIcon, CircleCheckIcon, InfoIcon, LoaderIcon, XIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Dynamic } from 'solid-js/web'

const uploadFile = () => {
  return new Promise<void>((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      Math.random() > 0.5 ? resolve() : reject(new Error('Upload failed'))
    }, 2000)
  })
}

export const PromiseToast = () => {
  const toaster = createToaster({
    overlap: true,
    placement: 'bottom-end',
    gap: 16,
  })

  const handleUpload = async () => {
    toaster.promise(uploadFile, {
      loading: {
        title: 'Uploading...',
        description: 'Please wait while we process your request.',
      },
      success: {
        title: 'Success!',
        description: 'Your request has been processed successfully.',
      },
      error: {
        title: 'Failed',
        description: 'Something went wrong. Please try again.',
      },
    })
  }

  const getIcon = (type: string | undefined) => {
    switch (type) {
      case 'loading':
        return LoaderIcon
      case 'success':
        return CircleCheckIcon
      case 'error':
        return CircleAlertIcon
      default:
        return InfoIcon
    }
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button type="button" onClick={handleUpload}>
        Start Process
      </button>

      <Toaster toaster={toaster}>
        {(toast) => {
          const icon = () => getIcon(toast().type)
          return (
            <Toast.Root>
              <div style={{ display: 'flex', 'align-items': 'flex-start', gap: '12px' }}>
                <Dynamic
                  component={icon()}
                  style={toast().type === 'loading' ? { animation: 'spin 1s linear infinite' } : {}}
                />
                <div style={{ flex: 1 }}>
                  <Toast.Title>{toast().title}</Toast.Title>
                  <Toast.Description>{toast().description}</Toast.Description>
                </div>
                <Toast.CloseTrigger>
                  <XIcon />
                </Toast.CloseTrigger>
              </div>
            </Toast.Root>
          )
        }}
      </Toaster>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Update Toast

To update a toast, use the `toast.update` method.

```tsx
import { Toast, Toaster, createToaster } from '@ark-ui/solid/toast'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'

const toaster = createToaster({
  placement: 'bottom-end',
  overlap: true,
  gap: 24,
})

export const Update = () => {
  const [id, setId] = createSignal<string | undefined>(undefined)

  const createToast = () => {
    const newId = toaster.create({
      title: 'Loading',
      description: 'Loading ...',
      type: 'info',
    })
    setId(newId)
  }

  const updateToast = () => {
    const currentId = id()
    if (!currentId) {
      return
    }
    toaster.update(currentId, {
      title: 'Success',
      description: 'Success!',
    })
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button type="button" onClick={createToast}>
        Create Toast
      </button>
      <button type="button" onClick={updateToast}>
        Update Toast
      </button>
      <Toaster toaster={toaster}>
        {(toast) => (
          <Toast.Root>
            <Toast.Title>{toast().title}</Toast.Title>
            <Toast.Description>{toast().description}</Toast.Description>
          </Toast.Root>
        )}
      </Toaster>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Action

To add an action to a toast, use the `toast.action` property.

```tsx
import { Toast, Toaster, createToaster } from '@ark-ui/solid/toast'

const toaster = createToaster({
  placement: 'bottom-end',
  gap: 24,
})

export const Action = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <button
        type="button"
        onClick={() =>
          toaster.create({
            title: 'Toast Title',
            description: 'Toast Description',
            type: 'info',
            action: {
              label: 'Subscribe',
              onClick: () => {
                console.log('Subscribe')
              },
            },
          })
        }
      >
        Add Toast
      </button>
      <Toaster toaster={toaster}>
        {(toast) => (
          <Toast.Root>
            <Toast.Title>{toast().title}</Toast.Title>
            <Toast.Description>{toast().description}</Toast.Description>
            {toast().action && <Toast.ActionTrigger>{toast().action?.label}</Toast.ActionTrigger>}
          </Toast.Root>
        )}
      </Toaster>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Custom Duration

You can control how long a toast stays visible by setting a custom `duration` in milliseconds, or use `Infinity` to keep
it visible until manually dismissed.

```tsx
import { Toast, Toaster, createToaster } from '@ark-ui/solid/toast'
import { XIcon, ClockIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

const durations = [
  { label: '1s', value: 1000 },
  { label: '3s', value: 3000 },
  { label: '5s', value: 5000 },
  { label: '∞', value: Infinity },
]

export const Duration = () => {
  const toaster = createToaster({
    overlap: true,
    placement: 'bottom-end',
    gap: 16,
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <div style={{ display: 'flex', 'flex-wrap': 'wrap', gap: '8px' }}>
        <For each={durations}>
          {(duration) => (
            <button
              type="button"
              onClick={() =>
                toaster.create({
                  title: `Toast (${duration.label})`,
                  description: `This toast will ${
                    duration.value === Infinity ? 'stay until dismissed' : `disappear in ${duration.label}`
                  }.`,
                  type: 'info',
                  duration: duration.value,
                })
              }
            >
              {duration.label}
            </button>
          )}
        </For>
      </div>

      <Toaster toaster={toaster}>
        {(toast) => (
          <Toast.Root>
            <div style={{ display: 'flex', 'align-items': 'flex-start', gap: '12px' }}>
              <ClockIcon />
              <div style={{ flex: 1 }}>
                <Toast.Title>{toast().title}</Toast.Title>
                <Toast.Description>{toast().description}</Toast.Description>
              </div>
              <Toast.CloseTrigger>
                <XIcon />
              </Toast.CloseTrigger>
            </div>
          </Toast.Root>
        )}
      </Toaster>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Maximum Visible Toasts

Set the `max` prop on the `createToaster` function to define the maximum number of toasts that can be rendered at any
one time. Any extra toasts will be queued and rendered when a toast has been dismissed.

```tsx
import { Toast, Toaster, createToaster } from '@ark-ui/solid/toast'
import { XIcon, InfoIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

export const MaxToasts = () => {
  const toaster = createToaster({
    max: 3,
    overlap: true,
    placement: 'bottom-end',
    gap: 16,
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <div style={{ display: 'flex', 'flex-wrap': 'wrap', gap: '8px' }}>
        <button
          type="button"
          onClick={() =>
            toaster.create({
              title: `Toast ${Date.now()}`,
              description: 'Maximum of 3 toasts visible at once. Extra toasts are queued.',
              type: 'info',
            })
          }
        >
          Add Toast
        </button>
        <button
          type="button"
          onClick={() => {
            for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
              toaster.create({
                title: `Toast ${i}`,
                description: `This is toast number ${i}`,
                type: 'info',
              })
            }
          }}
        >
          Add 5 Toasts
        </button>
      </div>

      <Toaster toaster={toaster}>
        {(toast) => (
          <Toast.Root>
            <div style={{ display: 'flex', 'align-items': 'flex-start', gap: '12px' }}>
              <InfoIcon />
              <div style={{ flex: 1 }}>
                <Toast.Title>{toast().title}</Toast.Title>
                <Toast.Description>{toast().description}</Toast.Description>
              </div>
              <Toast.CloseTrigger>
                <XIcon />
              </Toast.CloseTrigger>
            </div>
          </Toast.Root>
        )}
      </Toaster>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Guides

### Creating Toast in Effects

When creating a toast inside React effects (like `useEffect`, `useLayoutEffect`, or event handlers that trigger during
render), you may encounter a "flushSync" warning. To avoid this, wrap the toast call in `queueMicrotask`:

```tsx
import { useEffect } from 'react'

export const EffectToast = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    // ❌ This may cause flushSync warnings
    // toaster.create({ title: 'Effect triggered!' })

    // ✅ Wrap in queueMicrotask to avoid warnings
    queueMicrotask(() => {
      toaster.create({
        title: 'Effect triggered!',
        description: 'This toast was called safely from an effect',
        type: 'success',
      })
    })
  }, [])

  return <div>Component content</div>
}
```

This ensures the toast creation is deferred until after the current execution context, preventing React's concurrent
rendering warnings.

### Styling the toast

There's a minimal styling required for the toast to work correctly.

#### Toast root

The toast root will be assigned these css properties at runtime:

- `--x` - The x position
- `--y` - The y position
- `--scale` - The scale
- `--z-index` - The z-index
- `--height` - The height
- `--opacity` - The opacity
- `--gap` - The gap between toasts

```css
[data-scope='toast'][data-part='root'] {
  translate: var(--x) var(--y);
  scale: var(--scale);
  z-index: var(--z-index);
  height: var(--height);
  opacity: var(--opacity);
  will-change: translate, opacity, scale;
  transition:
    translate 400ms,
    scale 400ms,
    opacity 400ms,
    height 400ms,
    box-shadow 200ms;
  transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.21, 1.02, 0.73, 1);

  &[data-state='closed'] {
    transition:
      translate 400ms,
      scale 400ms,
      opacity 200ms;
    transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.06, 0.71, 0.55, 1);
  }
}
```

#### Styling based on type

You can also style based on the `data-type` attribute.

```css
[data-scope='toast'][data-part='root'] {
  &[data-type='error'] {
    background: red;
    color: white;
  }

  &[data-type='info'] {
    background: blue;
    color: white;
  }

  &[data-type='warning'] {
    background: orange;
  }

  &[data-type='success'] {
    background: green;
    color: white;
  }
}
```

#### Mobile considerations

A very common use case is to adjust the toast width on mobile so it spans the full width of the screen.

```css
@media (max-width: 640px) {
  [data-scope='toast'][data-part='group'] {
    width: 100%;
  }

  [data-scope='toast'][data-part='root'] {
    inset-inline: 0;
    width: calc(100% - var(--gap) * 2);
  }
}
```

# Toggle Group



## Anatomy

To set up the toggle group correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



## Examples

Learn how to use the `ToggleGroup` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

```tsx
import { ToggleGroup } from '@ark-ui/solid/toggle-group'

export const Basic = () => {
  return (
    <ToggleGroup.Root>
      <ToggleGroup.Item value="a">A</ToggleGroup.Item>
      <ToggleGroup.Item value="b">B</ToggleGroup.Item>
      <ToggleGroup.Item value="c">C</ToggleGroup.Item>
    </ToggleGroup.Root>
  )
}
```

### Multiple Selection

Demonstrates how to enable `multiple` selection within the group.

```tsx
import { ToggleGroup } from '@ark-ui/solid/toggle-group'

export const Multiple = () => {
  return (
    <ToggleGroup.Root multiple>
      <ToggleGroup.Item value="a">A</ToggleGroup.Item>
      <ToggleGroup.Item value="b">B</ToggleGroup.Item>
      <ToggleGroup.Item value="c">C</ToggleGroup.Item>
    </ToggleGroup.Root>
  )
}
```

### Initial Value

Shows how to set an initial value in the toggle group.

```tsx
import { ToggleGroup } from '@ark-ui/solid/toggle-group'

export const InitialValue = () => {
  return (
    <ToggleGroup.Root value={['b']}>
      <ToggleGroup.Item value="a">A</ToggleGroup.Item>
      <ToggleGroup.Item value="b">B</ToggleGroup.Item>
      <ToggleGroup.Item value="c">C</ToggleGroup.Item>
    </ToggleGroup.Root>
  )
}
```

### Using the Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the toggle-group. It accepts the value of the `useToggle-group`
hook. You can leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the toggle-group.

```tsx
import { ToggleGroup, useToggleGroup } from '@ark-ui/solid/toggle-group'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const toggleGroup = useToggleGroup()

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => toggleGroup().setValue(['b'])}>Set to B</button>

      <ToggleGroup.RootProvider value={toggleGroup}>
        <ToggleGroup.Item value="a">A</ToggleGroup.Item>
        <ToggleGroup.Item value="b">B</ToggleGroup.Item>
        <ToggleGroup.Item value="c">C</ToggleGroup.Item>
      </ToggleGroup.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

export const Basic = () => {
  return (
    <Toggle.Root>
      <BoldIcon />
    </Toggle.Root>
  )
}
```

### Controlled

Use the `pressed` and `onPressedChange` props to control the toggle's state.

```tsx
import { Toggle } from '@ark-ui/solid/toggle'
import { Volume, VolumeOff } from 'lucide-solid'
import { Show, createSignal } from 'solid-js'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [pressed, setPressed] = createSignal(false)
  return (
    <div>
      <Toggle.Root pressed={pressed()} onPressedChange={setPressed}>
        <Show when={pressed()} fallback={<VolumeOff />}>
          <Volume />
        </Show>

# Tooltip



## Anatomy

To set up the tooltip correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



## Examples

Learn how to use the `Tooltip` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

```tsx
import { Tooltip } from '@ark-ui/solid/tooltip'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const Basic = () => (
  <Tooltip.Root>
    <Tooltip.Trigger>Hover Me</Tooltip.Trigger>
    <Portal>
      <Tooltip.Positioner>
        <Tooltip.Content>I am a tooltip!</Tooltip.Content>
      </Tooltip.Positioner>
    </Portal>
  </Tooltip.Root>
)
```

### Controlled Tooltip

To create a controlled Tooltip component, manage the state of whether the tooltip is open using the `open` prop:

```tsx
import { Tooltip } from '@ark-ui/solid/tooltip'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const Controlled = () => {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = createSignal(false)
  return (
    <>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => setIsOpen(!isOpen())}>
        Toggle
      </button>
      <Tooltip.Root open={isOpen()}>
        <Tooltip.Trigger>Hover Me</Tooltip.Trigger>
        <Portal>
          <Tooltip.Positioner>
            <Tooltip.Content>I am a tooltip!</Tooltip.Content>
          </Tooltip.Positioner>
        </Portal>
      </Tooltip.Root>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Using a Render Function

For more control over the Tooltip's functionality, you can use a function as a child, which provides access to the
Tooltip API:

```tsx
import { Tooltip } from '@ark-ui/solid/tooltip'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const RenderFn = () => (
  <Tooltip.Root>
    <Tooltip.Trigger>Hover Me</Tooltip.Trigger>
    <Portal>
      <Tooltip.Positioner>
        <Tooltip.Context>
          {(context) => <Tooltip.Content>This tooltip is open: {context().open.toString()}</Tooltip.Content>}
        </Tooltip.Context>
      </Tooltip.Positioner>
    </Portal>
  </Tooltip.Root>
)
```

### Adding an Arrow

To display an arrow pointing to the trigger from the tooltip, use the `Tooltip.Arrow` and `Tooltip.ArrowTip` components:

```tsx
import { Tooltip } from '@ark-ui/solid/tooltip'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const Arrow = () => (
  <Tooltip.Root>
    <Tooltip.Trigger>Hover Me</Tooltip.Trigger>
    <Portal>
      <Tooltip.Positioner>
        <Tooltip.Content>
          <Tooltip.Arrow>
            <Tooltip.ArrowTip />
          </Tooltip.Arrow>
          I am a tooltip!
        </Tooltip.Content>
      </Tooltip.Positioner>
    </Portal>
  </Tooltip.Root>
)
```

### Configuring Delay Timings

To configure the delay timings for the Tooltip, use the `closeDelay` and `openDelay` props:

```tsx
import { Tooltip } from '@ark-ui/solid/tooltip'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const Timings = () => (
  <Tooltip.Root closeDelay={0} openDelay={0}>
    <Tooltip.Trigger>Hover Me</Tooltip.Trigger>
    <Portal>
      <Tooltip.Positioner>
        <Tooltip.Content>I am a tooltip!</Tooltip.Content>
      </Tooltip.Positioner>
    </Portal>
  </Tooltip.Root>
)
```

### Custom Positioning

To customize the position of the Tooltip relative to the trigger, use the `positioning` prop:

```tsx
import { Tooltip } from '@ark-ui/solid/tooltip'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const Positioning = () => (
  <Tooltip.Root
    positioning={{
      placement: 'left-start',
      offset: { mainAxis: 12, crossAxis: 12 },
    }}
  >
    <Tooltip.Trigger>Hover Me</Tooltip.Trigger>
    <Portal>
      <Tooltip.Positioner>
        <Tooltip.Content>I am a tooltip!</Tooltip.Content>
      </Tooltip.Positioner>
    </Portal>
  </Tooltip.Root>
)
```

### Using the Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the tooltip. It accepts the value of the `useTooltip` hook. You can
leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the tooltip.

```tsx
import { Tooltip, useTooltip } from '@ark-ui/solid/tooltip'
import { Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const tooltip = useTooltip()

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => tooltip().setOpen(true)}>Open</button>

      <Tooltip.RootProvider value={tooltip}>
        <Tooltip.Trigger>Hover Me</Tooltip.Trigger>
        <Portal>
          <Tooltip.Positioner>
            <Tooltip.Content>I am a tooltip!</Tooltip.Content>
          </Tooltip.Positioner>
        </Portal>
      </Tooltip.RootProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

# Tour



## Features

- Support for different step types such as "dialog", "floating", "tooltip" or "wait"
- Support for customizable content per step
- Wait steps for waiting for a specific selector to appear on the page before showing the next step
- Flexible positioning of the tour dialog per step
- Progress tracking shows users their progress through the tour

## Anatomy

To set up the tour correctly, it's essential to understand its anatomy and the naming of its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



## Steps

### Using step types

The tour machine supports different types of steps, allowing you to create a diverse and interactive tour experience.
The available step types are defined in the `StepType` type:

- `tooltip`: Displays the step content as a tooltip, typically positioned near the target element.

- `dialog`: Shows the step content in a modal dialog centered on screen, useful for starting or ending the tour. This
  usually don't have a `target` defined.

- `floating`: Presents the step content as a floating element, which can be positioned flexibly on the screen. This
  usually don't have a `target` defined.

- `wait`: A special type that waits for a specific condition before proceeding to the next step.

```tsx
const steps: TourStepDetails[] = [
  {
    id: 'step-1',
    type: 'tooltip',
    placement: 'top-start',
    target: () => document.querySelector('#target-1'),
    title: 'Tooltip Step',
    description: 'This is a tooltip step',
  },
  {
    id: 'step-2',
    type: 'dialog',
    title: 'Dialog Step',
    description: 'This is a dialog step',
  },
  {
    id: 'step-3',
    type: 'floating',
    placement: 'top-start',
    title: 'Floating Step',
    description: 'This is a floating step',
  },
  {
    id: 'step-4',
    type: 'wait',
    title: 'Wait Step',
    description: 'This is a wait step',
    effect({ next }) {
      // do something and go next
      // you can also return a cleanup
    },
  },
]
```

### Configuring actions

Every step supports a list of actions that are rendered in the step footer.Use the `actions` property to define each
action.

```tsx
const steps: TourStepDetails[] = [
  {
    id: 'step-1',
    type: 'dialog',
    title: 'Dialog Step',
    description: 'This is a dialog step',
    actions: [{ label: 'Show me a tour!', action: 'next' }],
  },
]
```

### Changing tooltip placement

Use the `placement` property to define the placement of the tooltip.

```tsx {5}
const steps: TourStepDetails[] = [
  {
    id: 'step-1',
    type: 'tooltip',
    placement: 'top-start',
    // ...
  },
]
```

### Hiding the arrow

Set `arrow: false` in the step property to hide the tooltip arrow. This is only useful for tooltip steps.

```tsx {5}
const steps: TourStepDetails[] = [
  {
    id: 'step-1',
    type: 'tooltip',
    arrow: false,
  },
]
```

### Hiding the backdrop

Set `backdrop: false` in the step property to hide the backdrop. This applies to all step types except the `wait` step.

```tsx {5}
const steps: TourStepDetails[] = [
  {
    id: 'step-1',
    type: 'dialog',
    backdrop: false,
  },
]
```

### Step Effects

Step effects are functions that are called before a step is opened. They are useful for adding custom logic to a step.

This function provides the following methods:

- `next()`: Call this method to move to the next step.
- `show()`: Call this method to show the current step.
- `update(details: StepDetails)`: Call this method to update the details of the current step (say, after data has been
  fetched).

```tsx
const steps: TourStepDetails[] = [
  {
    id: 'step-1',
    type: 'tooltip',
    effect({ next, show, update }) {
      fetchData().then((res) => {
        // update the step details
        update({ title: res.title })
        // then show show the step
        show()
      })

      return () => {
        // cleanup fetch data
      }
    },
  },
]
```

### Wait Steps

Wait steps are useful when you need to wait for a specific condition before proceeding to the next step.

Use the step `effect` function to perform an action and then call `next()` to move to the next step.

> **Note:** You cannot call `show()` in a wait step.

```tsx
const steps: TourStepDetails[] = [
  {
    id: 'step-1',
    type: 'wait',
    effect({ next }) {
      const button = document.querySelector('#button')
      const listener = () => next()
      button.addEventListener('click', listener)
      return () => button.removeEventListener('click', listener)
    },
  },
]
```

## Styling guide

Ensure the `box-sizing` is set to `border-box` for the means of measuring the tour target.

```css
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

Ensure the `body` has a `position` of `relative`.

```css
body {
  position: relative;
}
```

# Tree View



## Anatomy

To set up the tree view component correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



## Examples

Learn how to use the `TreeView` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

```tsx
import { TreeView, createTreeCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/tree-view'
import { SquareCheckBigIcon, ChevronRightIcon, FileIcon, FolderIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { For, Show } from 'solid-js'

export const Basic = () => {
  return (
    <TreeView.Root collection={collection}>
      <TreeView.Label>Tree</TreeView.Label>
      <TreeView.Tree>
        <For each={collection.rootNode.children}>{(node, index) => <TreeNode node={node} indexPath={[index()]} />}</For>
      </TreeView.Tree>
    </TreeView.Root>
  )
}

const TreeNode = (props: TreeView.NodeProviderProps<Node>) => {
  const { node, indexPath } = props
  return (
    <TreeView.NodeProvider node={node} indexPath={indexPath}>
      <Show
        when={node.children}
        fallback={
          <TreeView.Item>
            <TreeView.ItemIndicator>
              <SquareCheckBigIcon />
            </TreeView.ItemIndicator>
            <TreeView.ItemText>
              <FileIcon />
              {node.name}
            </TreeView.ItemText>
          </TreeView.Item>
        }
      >
        <TreeView.Branch>
          <TreeView.BranchControl>
            <TreeView.BranchText>
              <FolderIcon /> {node.name}
            </TreeView.BranchText>
            <TreeView.BranchIndicator>
              <ChevronRightIcon />
            </TreeView.BranchIndicator>
          </TreeView.BranchControl>
          <TreeView.BranchContent>
            <TreeView.BranchIndentGuide />
            <For each={node.children}>
              {(child, index) => <TreeNode node={child} indexPath={[...indexPath, index()]} />}
            </For>
          </TreeView.BranchContent>
        </TreeView.Branch>
      </Show>
    </TreeView.NodeProvider>
  )
}

interface Node {
  id: string
  name: string
  children?: Node[]
}

const collection = createTreeCollection<Node>({
  nodeToValue: (node) => node.id,
  nodeToString: (node) => node.name,
  rootNode: {
    id: 'ROOT',
    name: '',
    children: [
      {
        id: 'node_modules',
        name: 'node_modules',
        children: [
          { id: 'node_modules/zag-js', name: 'zag-js' },
          { id: 'node_modules/pandacss', name: 'panda' },
          {
            id: 'node_modules/@types',
            name: '@types',
            children: [
              { id: 'node_modules/@types/react', name: 'react' },
              { id: 'node_modules/@types/react-dom', name: 'react-dom' },
            ],
          },
        ],
      },
      {
        id: 'src',
        name: 'src',
        children: [
          { id: 'src/app.tsx', name: 'app.tsx' },
          { id: 'src/index.ts', name: 'index.ts' },
        ],
      },
      { id: 'panda.config', name: 'panda.config.ts' },
      { id: 'package.json', name: 'package.json' },
      { id: 'renovate.json', name: 'renovate.json' },
      { id: 'readme.md', name: 'README.md' },
    ],
  },
})
```

### Controlled Expanded

Pass the `expandedValue` and `onExpandedChange` props to the `TreeView.Root` component to control the expanded state of
the tree view.

```tsx
import { TreeView, createTreeCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/tree-view'
import { SquareCheckBigIcon, ChevronRightIcon, FileIcon, FolderIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { For, Show, createSignal } from 'solid-js'

export const ControlledExpanded = () => {
  const [expandedValue, setExpandedValue] = createSignal<string[]>(['node_modules'])

  return (
    <TreeView.Root
      collection={collection}
      expandedValue={expandedValue()}
      onExpandedChange={({ expandedValue }) => setExpandedValue(expandedValue)}
    >
      <TreeView.Label>Tree</TreeView.Label>
      <TreeView.Tree>
        <For each={collection.rootNode.children}>{(node, index) => <TreeNode node={node} indexPath={[index()]} />}</For>
      </TreeView.Tree>
    </TreeView.Root>
  )
}

const TreeNode = (props: TreeView.NodeProviderProps<Node>) => {
  const { node, indexPath } = props
  return (
    <TreeView.NodeProvider node={node} indexPath={indexPath}>
      <Show
        when={node.children}
        fallback={
          <TreeView.Item>
            <TreeView.ItemIndicator>
              <SquareCheckBigIcon />
            </TreeView.ItemIndicator>
            <TreeView.ItemText>
              <FileIcon />
              {node.name}
            </TreeView.ItemText>
          </TreeView.Item>
        }
      >
        <TreeView.Branch>
          <TreeView.BranchControl>
            <TreeView.BranchText>
              <FolderIcon /> {node.name}
            </TreeView.BranchText>
            <TreeView.BranchIndicator>
              <ChevronRightIcon />
            </TreeView.BranchIndicator>
          </TreeView.BranchControl>
          <TreeView.BranchContent>
            <TreeView.BranchIndentGuide />
            <For each={node.children}>
              {(child, index) => <TreeNode node={child} indexPath={[...indexPath, index()]} />}
            </For>
          </TreeView.BranchContent>
        </TreeView.Branch>
      </Show>
    </TreeView.NodeProvider>
  )
}

interface Node {
  id: string
  name: string
  children?: Node[]
}

const collection = createTreeCollection<Node>({
  nodeToValue: (node) => node.id,
  nodeToString: (node) => node.name,
  rootNode: {
    id: 'ROOT',
    name: '',
    children: [
      {
        id: 'node_modules',
        name: 'node_modules',
        children: [
          { id: 'node_modules/zag-js', name: 'zag-js' },
          { id: 'node_modules/pandacss', name: 'panda' },
          {
            id: 'node_modules/@types',
            name: '@types',
            children: [
              { id: 'node_modules/@types/react', name: 'react' },
              { id: 'node_modules/@types/react-dom', name: 'react-dom' },
            ],
          },
        ],
      },
      {
        id: 'src',
        name: 'src',
        children: [
          { id: 'src/app.tsx', name: 'app.tsx' },
          { id: 'src/index.ts', name: 'index.ts' },
        ],
      },
      { id: 'panda.config', name: 'panda.config.ts' },
      { id: 'package.json', name: 'package.json' },
      { id: 'renovate.json', name: 'renovate.json' },
      { id: 'readme.md', name: 'README.md' },
    ],
  },
})
```

### Controlled Selection

Pass the `selectedValue` and `onSelectionChange` props to the `TreeView.Root` component to control the selected state of
the tree view.

```tsx
import { TreeView, createTreeCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/tree-view'
import { SquareCheckBigIcon, ChevronRightIcon, FileIcon, FolderIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { For, Show, createSignal } from 'solid-js'

export const ControlledSelected = () => {
  const [selectedValue, setSelectedValue] = createSignal<string[]>(['package.json'])

  return (
    <TreeView.Root
      collection={collection}
      selectedValue={selectedValue()}
      onSelectionChange={({ selectedValue }) => setSelectedValue(selectedValue)}
    >
      <TreeView.Label>Tree</TreeView.Label>
      <TreeView.Tree>
        <For each={collection.rootNode.children}>{(node, index) => <TreeNode node={node} indexPath={[index()]} />}</For>
      </TreeView.Tree>
    </TreeView.Root>
  )
}

const TreeNode = (props: TreeView.NodeProviderProps<Node>) => {
  const { node, indexPath } = props
  return (
    <TreeView.NodeProvider node={node} indexPath={indexPath}>
      <Show
        when={node.children}
        fallback={
          <TreeView.Item>
            <TreeView.ItemIndicator>
              <SquareCheckBigIcon />
            </TreeView.ItemIndicator>
            <TreeView.ItemText>
              <FileIcon />
              {node.name}
            </TreeView.ItemText>
          </TreeView.Item>
        }
      >
        <TreeView.Branch>
          <TreeView.BranchControl>

      { id: 'readme.md', name: 'README.md' },
    ],
  },
})
```

### Root Provider

Use the `useTreeView` hook to create the tree view store and pass it to the `TreeView.RootProvider` component. This
allows you to have maximum control over the tree view programmatically.

```tsx
import { TreeView, createTreeCollection, useTreeView } from '@ark-ui/solid/tree-view'
import { SquareCheckBigIcon, ChevronRightIcon, FileIcon, FolderIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { For, Show } from 'solid-js'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const treeView = useTreeView({ collection })

  return (
    <TreeView.RootProvider value={treeView}>
      <TreeView.Label>Tree</TreeView.Label>
      <TreeView.Tree>
        <For each={collection.rootNode.children}>{(node, index) => <TreeNode node={node} indexPath={[index()]} />}</For>
      </TreeView.Tree>
    </TreeView.RootProvider>
  )
}

const TreeNode = (props: TreeView.NodeProviderProps<Node>) => {
  const { node, indexPath } = props
  return (
    <TreeView.NodeProvider node={node} indexPath={indexPath}>
      <Show
        when={node.children}
        fallback={
          <TreeView.Item>
            <TreeView.ItemIndicator>
              <SquareCheckBigIcon />
            </TreeView.ItemIndicator>
            <TreeView.ItemText>
              <FileIcon />
              {node.name}
            </TreeView.ItemText>
          </TreeView.Item>
        }
      >
        <TreeView.Branch>
          <TreeView.BranchControl>
            <TreeView.BranchText>
              <FolderIcon /> {node.name}
            </TreeView.BranchText>
            <TreeView.BranchIndicator>
              <ChevronRightIcon />
            </TreeView.BranchIndicator>
          </TreeView.BranchControl>
          <TreeView.BranchContent>
            <TreeView.BranchIndentGuide />
            <For each={node.children}>
              {(child, index) => <TreeNode node={child} indexPath={[...indexPath, index()]} />}
            </For>
          </TreeView.BranchContent>
        </TreeView.Branch>
      </Show>
    </TreeView.NodeProvider>
  )
}

interface Node {
  id: string
  name: string
  children?: Node[]
}

const collection = createTreeCollection<Node>({
  nodeToValue: (node) => node.id,
  nodeToString: (node) => node.name,
  rootNode: {
    id: 'ROOT',
    name: '',
    children: [
      {
        id: 'node_modules',
        name: 'node_modules',
        children: [
          { id: 'node_modules/zag-js', name: 'zag-js' },
          { id: 'node_modules/pandacss', name: 'panda' },
          {
            id: 'node_modules/@types',
            name: '@types',
            children: [
              { id: 'node_modules/@types/react', name: 'react' },
              { id: 'node_modules/@types/react-dom', name: 'react-dom' },
            ],
          },
        ],
      },
      {
        id: 'src',
        name: 'src',
        children: [
          { id: 'src/app.tsx', name: 'app.tsx' },
          { id: 'src/index.ts', name: 'index.ts' },
        ],
      },
      { id: 'panda.config', name: 'panda.config.ts' },
      { id: 'package.json', name: 'package.json' },
      { id: 'renovate.json', name: 'renovate.json' },
      { id: 'readme.md', name: 'README.md' },
    ],
  },
})
```

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

### Lazy Loading

Lazy loading is a feature that allows the tree view to load children of a node on demand (or async). This helps to
improve the initial load time and memory usage.

To use this, you need to provide the following:

- `loadChildren` — A function that is used to load the children of a node.
- `onLoadChildrenComplete` — A callback that is called when the children of a node are loaded. Used to update the tree
  collection.
- `childrenCount` — A number that indicates the number of children of a branch node.

```tsx
import { TreeView, createTreeCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/tree-view'
import { SquareCheckBigIcon, ChevronRightIcon, FileIcon, FolderIcon, LoaderCircleIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { For, createSignal } from 'solid-js'
import { useTreeViewNodeContext } from '../use-tree-view-node-context'

// mock api result
const response: Record<string, Node[]> = {
  node_modules: [
    { id: 'zag-js', name: 'zag-js' },
    { id: 'pandacss', name: 'panda' },
    { id: '@types', name: '@types', childrenCount: 2 },
  ],
  'node_modules/@types': [
    { id: 'react', name: 'react' },
    { id: 'react-dom', name: 'react-dom' },
  ],
  src: [
    { id: 'app.tsx', name: 'app.tsx' },
    { id: 'index.ts', name: 'index.ts' },
  ],
}

// function to load children of a node
function loadChildren(details: TreeView.LoadChildrenDetails<Node>): Promise<Node[]> {
  const value = details.valuePath.join('/')
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve(response[value] ?? [])
    }, 1200)
  })
}

export const AsyncLoading = () => {
  const [collection, setCollection] = createSignal(initialCollection)
  return (
    <TreeView.Root
      collection={collection()}
      loadChildren={loadChildren}
      onLoadChildrenComplete={(e) => setCollection(e.collection)}
    >
      <TreeView.Label>Tree</TreeView.Label>
      <TreeView.Tree>
        <For each={collection().rootNode.children}>
          {(node, index) => <TreeNode node={node} indexPath={[index()]} />}
        </For>
      </TreeView.Tree>
    </TreeView.Root>
  )
}

function TreeNodeIndicator() {
  const nodeState = useTreeViewNodeContext()
  return nodeState().loading ? <LoaderCircleIcon style={{ animation: 'spin 1s infinite' }} /> : <FolderIcon />
}

const TreeNode = (props: TreeView.NodeProviderProps<Node>) => {
  const { node, indexPath } = props
  return (
    <TreeView.NodeProvider node={node} indexPath={indexPath}>
      {node.children || node.childrenCount ? (
        <TreeView.Branch>
          <TreeView.BranchControl>
            <TreeView.BranchText>
              <TreeNodeIndicator /> {node.name}
            </TreeView.BranchText>
            <TreeView.BranchIndicator>
              <ChevronRightIcon />
            </TreeView.BranchIndicator>
          </TreeView.BranchControl>
          <TreeView.BranchContent>
            <TreeView.BranchIndentGuide />
            <For each={node.children}>
              {(child, index) => <TreeNode node={child} indexPath={[...indexPath, index()]} />}
            </For>
          </TreeView.BranchContent>
        </TreeView.Branch>
      ) : (
        <TreeView.Item>
          <TreeView.ItemIndicator>
            <SquareCheckBigIcon />
          </TreeView.ItemIndicator>
          <TreeView.ItemText>
            <FileIcon />
            {node.name}
          </TreeView.ItemText>
        </TreeView.Item>
      )}
    </TreeView.NodeProvider>
  )
}

interface Node {
  id: string
  name: string
  children?: Node[]
  childrenCount?: number
}

const initialCollection = createTreeCollection<Node>({
  nodeToValue: (node) => node.id,
  nodeToString: (node) => node.name,
  rootNode: {
    id: 'ROOT',
    name: '',
    children: [
      { id: 'node_modules', name: 'node_modules', childrenCount: 3 },
      { id: 'src', name: 'src', childrenCount: 2 },
      { id: 'panda.config', name: 'panda.config.ts' },
      { id: 'package.json', name: 'package.json' },
      { id: 'renovate.json', name: 'renovate.json' },
      { id: 'readme.md', name: 'README.md' },
    ],
  },
})
```

### Lazy Mount

Lazy mounting is a feature that allows the content of a tree view to be rendered only when it is expanded. This is
useful for performance optimization, especially when tree content is large or complex. To enable lazy mounting, use the
`lazyMount` prop on the `TreeView.Root` component.

In addition, the `unmountOnExit` prop can be used in conjunction with `lazyMount` to unmount the tree view content when
branches are collapsed, freeing up resources. The next time a branch is expanded, its content will be re-rendered.

```tsx
import { TreeView, createTreeCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/tree-view'
import { SquareCheckBigIcon, ChevronRightIcon, FileIcon, FolderIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { For, Show } from 'solid-js'

interface Node {
  id: string
  name: string
  children?: Node[]
}

const collection = createTreeCollection<Node>({
  nodeToValue: (node) => node.id,
  nodeToString: (node) => node.name,
  rootNode: {
    id: 'ROOT',
    name: '',
    children: [
      {
        id: 'node_modules',
        name: 'node_modules',
        children: [
          { id: 'node_modules/zag-js', name: 'zag-js' },
          { id: 'node_modules/pandacss', name: 'panda' },
          {
            id: 'node_modules/@types',
            name: '@types',
            children: [
              { id: 'node_modules/@types/react', name: 'react' },
              { id: 'node_modules/@types/react-dom', name: 'react-dom' },
            ],
          },
        ],
      },
      {
        id: 'src',
        name: 'src',
        children: [
          { id: 'src/app.tsx', name: 'app.tsx' },
          { id: 'src/index.ts', name: 'index.ts' },
        ],
      },
      { id: 'panda.config', name: 'panda.config.ts' },
      { id: 'package.json', name: 'package.json' },
      { id: 'renovate.json', name: 'renovate.json' },
      { id: 'readme.md', name: 'README.md' },
    ],
  },
})

export const LazyMount = () => {
  return (
    <TreeView.Root collection={collection} lazyMount unmountOnExit>
      <TreeView.Label>Tree</TreeView.Label>
      <TreeView.Tree>
        <For each={collection.rootNode.children}>{(node, index) => <TreeNode node={node} indexPath={[index()]} />}</For>
      </TreeView.Tree>
    </TreeView.Root>
  )
}

const TreeNode = (props: TreeView.NodeProviderProps<Node>) => {
  const { node, indexPath } = props
  return (
    <TreeView.NodeProvider node={node} indexPath={indexPath}>
      <Show
        when={node.children}
        fallback={
          <TreeView.Item>
            <TreeView.ItemIndicator>
              <SquareCheckBigIcon />
            </TreeView.ItemIndicator>
            <TreeView.ItemText>
              <FileIcon />
              {node.name}
            </TreeView.ItemText>
          </TreeView.Item>
        }
      >
        <TreeView.Branch>
          <TreeView.BranchControl>
            <TreeView.BranchText>
              <FolderIcon /> {node.name}
            </TreeView.BranchText>
            <TreeView.BranchIndicator>
              <ChevronRightIcon />
            </TreeView.BranchIndicator>
          </TreeView.BranchControl>
          <TreeView.BranchContent>
            <TreeView.BranchIndentGuide />
            <For each={node.children}>
              {(child, index) => <TreeNode node={child} indexPath={[...indexPath, index()]} />}
            </For>
          </TreeView.BranchContent>
        </TreeView.Branch>
      </Show>
    </TreeView.NodeProvider>
  )
}
```

### Filtering

Filtering is useful when you have a large tree and you want to filter the nodes to only show the ones that match the
search query. Here's an example that composes the `filter` method from the `TreeCollection` and `useFilter` hook to
filter the nodes.

```tsx
import { useFilter } from '@ark-ui/solid/locale'
import { TreeView, createTreeCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/tree-view'
import { SquareCheckBigIcon, ChevronRightIcon, FileIcon, FolderIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { For, Show, createSignal } from 'solid-js'

export const Filtering = () => {
  const filterFn = useFilter({ sensitivity: 'base' })
  const [collection, setCollection] = createSignal(initialCollection)

  const filter = (value: string) => {
    const filtered =
      value.length > 0 ? initialCollection.filter((node) => filterFn().contains(node.name, value)) : initialCollection
    setCollection(filtered)
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <input placeholder="Search" onInput={(e) => filter(e.currentTarget.value)} />
      <TreeView.Root collection={collection()}>
        <TreeView.Tree>
          <For each={collection().rootNode.children}>
            {(node, index) => <TreeNode node={node} indexPath={[index()]} />}
          </For>
        </TreeView.Tree>
      </TreeView.Root>
    </div>
  )
}

const TreeNode = (props: TreeView.NodeProviderProps<Node>) => {
  const { node, indexPath } = props
  return (
    <TreeView.NodeProvider node={node} indexPath={indexPath}>
      <Show
        when={node.children}
        fallback={
          <TreeView.Item>
            <TreeView.ItemIndicator>
              <SquareCheckBigIcon />
            </TreeView.ItemIndicator>
            <TreeView.ItemText>
              <FileIcon />
              {node.name}
            </TreeView.ItemText>
          </TreeView.Item>
        }
      >
        <TreeView.Branch>
          <TreeView.BranchControl>
            <TreeView.BranchText>
              <FolderIcon /> {node.name}
            </TreeView.BranchText>
            <TreeView.BranchIndicator>
              <ChevronRightIcon />
            </TreeView.BranchIndicator>
          </TreeView.BranchControl>
          <TreeView.BranchContent>
            <TreeView.BranchIndentGuide />
            <For each={node.children}>
              {(child, index) => <TreeNode node={child} indexPath={[...indexPath, index()]} />}
            </For>
          </TreeView.BranchContent>
        </TreeView.Branch>
      </Show>
    </TreeView.NodeProvider>
  )
}

interface Node {
  id: string
  name: string
  children?: Node[]
}

const initialCollection = createTreeCollection<Node>({
  nodeToValue: (node) => node.id,
  nodeToString: (node) => node.name,
  rootNode: {
    id: 'ROOT',
    name: '',
    children: [
      {
        id: 'node_modules',
        name: 'node_modules',
        children: [
          { id: 'node_modules/zag-js', name: 'zag-js' },
          { id: 'node_modules/pandacss', name: 'panda' },
          {
            id: 'node_modules/@types',
            name: '@types',
            children: [
              { id: 'node_modules/@types/react', name: 'react' },
              { id: 'node_modules/@types/react-dom', name: 'react-dom' },
            ],
          },
        ],
      },
      {
        id: 'src',
        name: 'src',
        children: [
          { id: 'src/app.tsx', name: 'app.tsx' },
          { id: 'src/index.ts', name: 'index.ts' },
        ],
      },
      { id: 'panda.config', name: 'panda.config.ts' },
      { id: 'package.json', name: 'package.json' },
      { id: 'renovate.json', name: 'renovate.json' },
      { id: 'readme.md', name: 'README.md' },
    ],
  },
})
```

### Links

Tree items can be rendered as links to another page or website. This could be useful for documentation sites.

Here's an example that modifies the tree collection to represent an hierarchical link structure. It uses the `asChild`
prop to render the tree items as links, passing the `href` prop to a `<a>` element.

```tsx
import { TreeView, createTreeCollection } from '@ark-ui/solid/tree-view'
import { ChevronRightIcon, ExternalLinkIcon, FileIcon } from 'lucide-solid'
import { For, Show } from 'solid-js'

export const Links = () => {
  return (
    <TreeView.Root collection={collection}>
      <TreeView.Label>Docs</TreeView.Label>
      <TreeView.Tree>
        <For each={collection.rootNode.children}>{(node, index) => <TreeNode node={node} indexPath={[index()]} />}</For>
      </TreeView.Tree>
    </TreeView.Root>
  )
}

const TreeNode = (props: TreeView.NodeProviderProps<Node>) => {
  const { node, indexPath } = props
  return (
    <TreeView.NodeProvider node={node} indexPath={indexPath}>
      <Show
        when={node.children}
        fallback={
          <TreeView.Item asChild={(props) => <a href={node.href} {...props()} />}>
            <TreeView.ItemText>
              <FileIcon />
              {node.name}
            </TreeView.ItemText>
            <Show when={node.href?.startsWith('http')}>
              <ExternalLinkIcon size={12} />
            </Show>
          </TreeView.Item>
        }
      >
        <TreeView.Branch>
          <TreeView.BranchControl>
            <TreeView.BranchText>{node.name}</TreeView.BranchText>
            <TreeView.BranchIndicator>
              <ChevronRightIcon />
            </TreeView.BranchIndicator>
          </TreeView.BranchControl>
          <TreeView.BranchContent>
            <TreeView.BranchIndentGuide />
            <For each={node.children}>
              {(child, index) => <TreeNode node={child} indexPath={[...indexPath, index()]} />}
            </For>

## Guides

### Type-Safety

The `TreeView.RootComponent` type enables you to create closed, strongly typed wrapper components that maintain full type
safety for tree nodes.

This is particularly useful when building reusable tree view components with custom props and consistent styling.

```tsx
import { TreeView as ArkTreeView, type TreeNode } from '@ark-ui/react/tree-view'
import { createTreeCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/collection'

interface TreeViewProps<T extends TreeNode> extends ArkTreeView.RootProps<T> {}

const TreeView: ArkTreeView.RootComponent = (props) => {
  return <ArkTreeView.Root {...props}>{/* ... */}</ArkTreeView.Root>
}
```

Then, you can use the `TreeView` component as follows:

```tsx
const App = () => {
  const collection = createTreeCollection({
    initialItems: [
      { id: '1', label: 'React', children: [] },
      { id: '2', label: 'Vue', children: [] },
      { id: '3', label: 'Svelte', children: [] },
    ],
  })
  return (
    <TreeView
      collection={collection}
      onSelectionChange={(e) => {
        // this will be strongly typed Array<{ id: string, label: string, children: [] }>
        console.log(e.value)
      }}
    >
      {/* ... */}
    </TreeView>
  )
}
```

# UTILITIES

---

# Client Only

## Motivation

The `ClientOnly` component renders its children only on the client side. This is useful for components that need to
access the DOM or browser APIs that are not available on the server side.

## Examples

### Basic

```tsx
import { ClientOnly } from '@ark-ui/solid/client-only'

export const Basic = () => (
  <ClientOnly>
    <div>This content is only rendered on the client side.</div>
  </ClientOnly>
)
```

### With Fallback

```tsx
import { ClientOnly } from '@ark-ui/solid/client-only'

export const WithFallback = () => (
  <ClientOnly fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
    <div>This content is only rendered on the client side.</div>
  </ClientOnly>
)
```

## API Reference

### ClientOnly

#### Props

**`fallback`**
Type: `number | boolean | Node | (string & {}) | ArrayElement`
Required: false
Default Value: `undefined`
Description: undefined


# Download Trigger

## Motivation

The `DownloadTrigger` component provides a convenient way to programmatically trigger file downloads in web
applications. It handles the complexities of downloading files, whether they are URLs, Blobs, or other data types.

## Examples

### Basic

Pass the data you want to download to the `data` prop, and specify the `fileName` and `mimeType` of the file.

```tsx
import { DownloadTrigger } from '@ark-ui/solid/download-trigger'

export const Basic = () => {
  return (
    <DownloadTrigger data="Hello world" fileName="hello.txt" mimeType="text/plain">
      Download txt
    </DownloadTrigger>
  )
}
```

### Download SVG

Here's an example of how to download an SVG file.

```tsx
import { DownloadTrigger } from '@ark-ui/solid/download-trigger'

export const Svg = () => {
  return (
    <DownloadTrigger
      data='<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100" height="100"><circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="red"/></svg>'
      fileName="circle.svg"
      mimeType="image/svg+xml"
    >
      Download SVG
    </DownloadTrigger>
  )
}
```

### Promise

You can also trigger downloads from a promise that returns a `Blob`, `File`, or `string`.

```tsx
import { DownloadTrigger } from '@ark-ui/solid/download-trigger'

export const WithPromise = () => {
  const fetchImage = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('https://picsum.photos/200/300')
    return response.blob()
  }

  return (
    <DownloadTrigger data={fetchImage} fileName="random-image.jpg" mimeType="image/jpeg">
      Download Image
    </DownloadTrigger>
  )
}
```

## API Reference




# Environment

## Motivation

We use [Zag.js](https://zagjs.com/overview/composition#custom-window-environment) internally, which relies on DOM query
methods like `document.querySelectorAll` and `document.getElementById`. In custom environments like iframes, Shadow DOM,
or Electron, these methods might not work as expected.

To handle this, Ark UI includes the `EnvironmentProvider`, allowing you to set the appropriate root node or document,
ensuring correct DOM queries.

## Setup

To support custom environments like an iframe, Shadow DOM or Electron, render the `EnvironmentProvider` component to
provide the environment context to all Ark UI components.

```tsx
import { EnvironmentProvider } from '@ark-ui/solid/environment'

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <iframe title="IFrame Context">
      <EnvironmentProvider>{/* Your App */}</EnvironmentProvider>
    </iframe>
  )
}
```

### Usage in iframe

The `EnvironmentProvider` component will automatically detect the current environment and set the correct environment
context. However, you can also manually set the `Document` like shown in this React example below:

```jsx
import Frame, { FrameContextConsumer } from 'react-frame-component'
import { EnvironmentProvider } from '@ark-ui/react'

export const App = () => (
  <Frame title="IFrame Context">
    <FrameContextConsumer>
      {({ document }) => <EnvironmentProvider value={document}>{/* Your App */}</EnvironmentProvider>}
    </FrameContextConsumer>
  </Frame>
)
```

### Usage in Shadow DOM

Here's an example of how to set the `EnvironmentProvider`'s value with Shadow DOM in Solid.js `Portal` component.

```jsx
import { EnvironmentProvider } from '@ark-ui/react'
import { Index, Portal } from 'solid-js/web'

export const App = () => {
  let portalNode
  return (
    <Portal ref={portalNode} useShadow={true}>
      <EnvironmentProvider value={() => portalNode?.shadowRoot ?? document}>{/* Your App */}</EnvironmentProvider>
    </Portal>
  )
}
```

## Context

Use the `useEnvironmentContext` hook to access the `RootNode`, `Document`, and `Window`.

```tsx
import { useEnvironmentContext } from '../use-environment-context'

export const Usage = () => {
  const environment = useEnvironmentContext()

  return <pre>{JSON.stringify(environment().getRootNode(), null, 2)}</pre>
}
```

## API Reference

### EnvironmentProvider

#### Props

**`value`**
Type: `RootNode | (() => RootNode)`
Required: false
Default Value: `undefined`
Description: undefined


# Focus Trap

## Motivation

Focus trapping is essential for modal interfaces and other interactive elements that require user attention.

The `FocusTrap` component helps maintain accessibility by ensuring keyboard focus remains within a designated container
until explicitly released.

## Examples

```tsx
import { FocusTrap } from '@ark-ui/solid/focus-trap'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'

export const Basic = () => {
  const [trapped, setTrapped] = createSignal(false)
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setTrapped(true)}>Start Trap</button>
      <FocusTrap returnFocusOnDeactivate={false} disabled={!trapped()}>
        <div
          style={{
            display: 'flex',
            'flex-direction': 'column',
            gap: '1rem',
            'padding-block': '1rem',
          }}
        >
          <input type="text" placeholder="input" />
          <textarea placeholder="textarea" />
          <button onClick={() => setTrapped(false)}>End Trap</button>
        </div>
      </FocusTrap>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Autofocus

The focus trap respects elements with the `autofocus` attribute.

```tsx
import { FocusTrap } from '@ark-ui/solid/focus-trap'
import { Show, createSignal } from 'solid-js'

export const Autofocus = () => {
  const [trapped, setTrapped] = createSignal(false)
  let buttonRef!: HTMLButtonElement

  return (
    <div>
      <button ref={buttonRef} onClick={() => setTrapped((v) => !v)}>
        {trapped() ? 'End Trap' : 'Start Trap'}
      </button>
      <Show when={trapped()}>
        <FocusTrap disabled={!trapped()} setReturnFocus={buttonRef}>
          <div
            style={{
              display: 'flex',
              'flex-direction': 'column',
              gap: '1rem',
              'padding-block': '1rem',
            }}
          >
            <input type="text" placeholder="Regular input" />
            <input type="text" placeholder="Autofocused input" autofocus />
            <button onClick={() => setTrapped(false)}>End Trap</button>
          </div>
        </FocusTrap>
      </Show>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Initial Focus

Use the `initialFocus` prop to set the element that should receive initial focus when the trap is activated.

```tsx
import { FocusTrap } from '@ark-ui/solid/focus-trap'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'

export const InitialFocus = () => {
  const [trapped, setTrapped] = createSignal(false)
  const toggle = () => setTrapped((v) => !v)

  let inputRef!: HTMLInputElement

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={toggle}>{trapped() ? 'End Trap' : 'Start Trap'}</button>
      <FocusTrap disabled={!trapped()} initialFocus={() => inputRef}>
        <div
          style={{
            display: 'flex',
            'flex-direction': 'column',
            gap: '1rem',
            'padding-block': '1rem',
          }}
        >
          <input type="text" placeholder="First input" />
          <input ref={inputRef} type="text" placeholder="Second input (initial focus)" />
          <textarea placeholder="textarea" />
          <button onClick={toggle}>End Trap</button>
        </div>
      </FocusTrap>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Usage

The byte formatting component extends the number formatting capabilities to handle byte-specific formatting, including
automatic unit conversion and display options.

```jsx
import { Format } from '@ark-ui/react'
```

## Examples

### Basic

Use the `Format.Byte` component to format a byte value with default options.

```tsx
import { Format } from '@ark-ui/solid/format'

export const ByteBasic = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      File size: <Format.Byte value={1450.45} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Sizes

Use the `sizes` prop to specify custom byte sizes for formatting.

```tsx
import { Format } from '@ark-ui/solid/format'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

export const ByteSizes = () => {
  const byteSizes = [50, 5000, 5000000, 5000000000]

  return (
    <div>
      <For each={byteSizes}>
        {(size) => (
          <div>
            <Format.Byte value={size} />
          </div>
        )}
      </For>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Locale

Use the `locale` prop to format the byte value according to a specific locale.

```tsx
import { Format } from '@ark-ui/solid/format'
import { LocaleProvider } from '@ark-ui/solid/locale'
import { For } from 'solid-js'

export const ByteWithLocale = () => {
  const locales = ['de-DE', 'zh-CN']
  const value = 1450.45

  return (
    <div>
      <For each={locales}>
        {(locale) => (
          <LocaleProvider locale={locale}>
            <Format.Byte value={value} />
          </LocaleProvider>
        )}
      </For>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Unit

Use the `unit` prop to specify the unit of the byte value.

```tsx
import { Format } from '@ark-ui/solid/format'

export const ByteWithUnit = () => {
  const value = 1450.45
  const unit = 'bit'

  return (
    <div>

  const unitDisplays = ['narrow', 'short', 'long'] as const

  return (
    <div>
      <For each={unitDisplays}>{(unitDisplay) => <Format.Byte value={value} unitDisplay={unitDisplay} />}</For>
    </div>
  )
}
```


# Format Number



## Usage

The number formatting logic is handled by the native `Intl.NumberFormat` API and smartly cached to avoid performance
issues when using the same locale and options.

```jsx
import { Format } from '@ark-ui/react'
```

## Examples

### Basic

Use the `Format.Number` component to format a number with default options.

```tsx
import { Format } from '@ark-ui/solid/format'

export const NumberBasic = () => {
  return <Format.Number value={1450.45} />
}
```

### Percentage

Use the `style="percent"` prop to format the number as a percentage.

```tsx
import { Format } from '@ark-ui/solid/format'

export const NumberWithPercentage = () => {
  return <Format.Number value={0.145} style="percent" maximumFractionDigits={2} minimumFractionDigits={2} />
}
```

### Currency

Use the `style="currency"` prop along with the `currency` prop to format the number as a currency.

```tsx
import { Format } from '@ark-ui/solid/format'

export const NumberWithCurrency = () => {
  return <Format.Number value={1234.45} style="currency" currency="USD" />
}
```

### Locale

Use the `locale` prop to format the number according to a specific locale.

```tsx
import { Format } from '@ark-ui/solid/format'
import { LocaleProvider } from '@ark-ui/solid/locale'

export const NumberWithLocale = () => {
  return (
    <LocaleProvider locale="de-DE">
      <Format.Number value={1450.45} />
    </LocaleProvider>
  )
}
```

### Unit

Use the `style="unit"` prop along with the `unit` prop to format the number with a specific unit.

```tsx
import { Format } from '@ark-ui/solid/format'

export const NumberWithUnit = () => {
  return <Format.Number value={384.4} style="unit" unit="kilometer" />
}
```

### Compact Notation

Use the `notation="compact"` prop to format the number in compact notation.

```tsx
import { Format } from '@ark-ui/solid/format'

export const NumberWithCompact = () => {
  return <Format.Number value={1500000} notation="compact" compactDisplay="short" />
}
```


# Format Relative Time



## Usage

The relative time formatting logic is handled by the native `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat` API and smartly cached to avoid
performance issues when using the same locale and options.

```jsx
import { Format } from '@ark-ui/react'
```

## Examples

### Basic

Use the `Format.RelativeTime` component to format a relative time with default options.

```tsx
import { Format } from '@ark-ui/solid/format'

export const RelativeTimeBasic = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      Edited <Format.RelativeTime value={new Date('2025-05-05')} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Short

Use the `style="short"` prop to format the relative time in short format.

```tsx
import { Format } from '@ark-ui/solid/format'

export const RelativeTimeShort = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      Edited <Format.RelativeTime value={new Date('2025-05-05')} style="short" />
    </div>
  )
}
```


# Frame



## Usage

The `Frame` component is used to render a component in an iframe.

- Tracks the size of the content and exposes them via css variables.
- Support for `head` prop to inject scripts and styles.
- Support for mount and unmount callbacks.

```jsx
import { Frame } from '@ark-ui/react'
```

## Examples

### Basic

Wrap your component in the `Frame` component to render it in an iframe.

```tsx
import { Frame } from '@ark-ui/solid/frame'

export const Basic = () => {
  return (
    <Frame
      title="Custom Frame"
      style={{ border: '1px solid #ccc', width: '100%', height: 'var(--height)' }}
      head={<style>{'body { background-color: #f0f0f0; }'}</style>}
    >
      <div style={{ padding: '40px' }}>
        <h1>Hello from inside the frame!</h1>
        <p>This content is rendered within our custom frame component using a Portal.</p>
      </div>
    </Frame>
  )
}
```

### Injecting Script

Using the `onMount` prop, you can inject a script into the iframe.

```tsx
import { Frame } from '@ark-ui/solid/frame'

export const Script = () => {
  let ref: HTMLIFrameElement | undefined
  return (
    <Frame
      ref={ref}
      title="Custom Frame"
      onMount={() => {
        const doc = ref?.contentDocument
        if (!doc) return
        const script = doc.createElement('script')
        script.innerHTML = 'console.log("Hello from inside the frame!")'
        doc.body.appendChild(script)
      }}
      style={{ border: '1px solid #ccc', width: '100%', height: 'var(--height)' }}
    >
      <div style={{ padding: '40px' }}>
        <h1>Hello from inside the frame!</h1>
        <p>This content is rendered within our custom frame component using a Portal.</p>
      </div>
    </Frame>
  )
}
```

### Custom src doc

Use the `srcDoc` prop to specify the HTML content of the page to use in the iframe.

```tsx
import { Frame } from '@ark-ui/solid/frame'

const srcDoc = `<html><head>
<link href="//use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.15.1/css/all.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<link href="//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,300,600,700" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
<base target=_blank>
</head><body style='overflow: hidden'><div></div></body></html>`

export const SrcDoc = () => {
  return (
    <Frame title="Custom Frame" style={{ border: '1px solid #ccc', width: '100%' }} srcdoc={srcDoc}>
      <h1 style={{ 'font-family': 'Open Sans, sans-serif' }}>Hello from inside the frame!</h1>
      <p>This content is rendered within our custom frame component using a Portal.</p>
      <p>The frame has custom initial content, including Font Awesome and Open Sans font.</p>
    </Frame>
  )
}
```


# Highlight



## Usage

The Highlight component takes a `text` prop containing the full text and a `query` prop specifying the text to
highlight. It then renders the text with highlighted portions wrapped in `<mark>` tags.

```tsx
import { Highlight } from '@ark-ui/solid/highlight'

export const Basic = () => {
  return (
    <Highlight
      query="ipsum"
      text="Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt"
    />
  )
}
```

### Multiple Queries

You can highlight multiple terms by passing an array of strings to the `query` prop.

```tsx
import { Highlight } from '@ark-ui/solid/highlight'

export const Multiple = () => {
  return (
    <Highlight
      query={['ipsum', 'amet']}
      text="Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt"
    />
  )
}
```

### Case Sensitivity

By default, the highlighting is case-sensitive. Use the `ignoreCase` prop to make it case-insensitive.

```tsx
import { Highlight } from '@ark-ui/solid/highlight'

export const IgnoreCase = () => (
  <Highlight text="The quick brown Fox jumps over the lazy Dog." query={['fox', 'dog']} ignoreCase />
)
```

### Match All

By default, the Highlight component matches the first occurrence of the query. To highlight all occurrences of the
query, set the `matchAll` prop to `true`.

```tsx
import { Highlight } from '@ark-ui/solid/highlight'

export const MatchAll = () => (
  <div>
    <h3>Match All</h3>
    <Highlight text="The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy fox." query="fox" matchAll={true} />

    <h3>Match First Occurrence Only</h3>
    <Highlight text="The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy fox." query="fox" matchAll={false} />
  </div>
)
```

### Exact Match

By default, the Highlight component matches partial words. Use the `exactMatch` prop to only highlight whole words that
match the query exactly.

```tsx
import { Highlight } from '@ark-ui/solid/highlight'

export const ExactMatch = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Without exactMatch (highlights partial matches):</p>
      <Highlight query="cat" text="The cat is in the category. A cat-like creature." matchAll />
      <p style={{ 'margin-top': '1rem' }}>With exactMatch (highlights whole words only):</p>
      <Highlight query="cat" text="The cat is in the category. A cat-like creature." exactMatch matchAll />
    </div>
  )
}
```

```

Style the `mark` tags using CSS to customize the appearance of highlighted text.

```css
.highlighted-text {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```


# JSON Tree View



## Anatomy

To set up the JSON tree view correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.



## Examples

Learn how to use the `JsonTreeView` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

```tsx
import { JsonTreeView } from '@ark-ui/solid/json-tree-view'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

export const Basic = () => {
  return (
    <JsonTreeView.Root
      data={{
        name: 'John Doe',
        age: 30,
        email: 'john.doe@example.com',
        tags: ['tag1', 'tag2', 'tag3'],
        address: {
          street: '123 Main St',
          city: 'Anytown',
          state: 'CA',
          zip: '12345',
        },
      }}
    >
      <JsonTreeView.Tree arrow={<ChevronRightIcon />} />
    </JsonTreeView.Root>
  )
}
```

### Different Data Types

The JSON tree view can display various JavaScript data types including objects, arrays, primitives, and special values:

```tsx
import { JsonTreeView } from '@ark-ui/solid/json-tree-view'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

const testArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Object.defineProperties(testArray, {
  customProperty: { value: 'custom value', enumerable: false, writable: false },
  anotherProperty: { value: 42, enumerable: false, writable: false },
})

export const ArrayData = () => {
  return (
    <JsonTreeView.Root
      data={{
        normalArray: [1, 2, 3],
        arrayWithNonEnumerableProperties: testArray,
        sparseArray: (() => {
          const sparse = []
          sparse[0] = 'first'
          sparse[5] = 'sixth'
          return sparse
        })(),
      }}
    >
      <JsonTreeView.Tree arrow={<ChevronRightIcon />} />
    </JsonTreeView.Root>
  )
}
```

### Functions and Methods

Display JavaScript functions, async functions, and generators in your JSON tree:

```tsx
import { JsonTreeView } from '@ark-ui/solid/json-tree-view'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

const data = [
  function sum(a: number, b: number) {
    return a + b
  },
  async (promises: Promise<any>[]) => await Promise.all(promises),
  function* generator(a: number) {
    while (a > 0) {
      yield a - 1
    }
  },
]

export const Functions = () => {
  return (
    <JsonTreeView.Root data={data}>
      <JsonTreeView.Tree arrow={<ChevronRightIcon />} />
    </JsonTreeView.Root>
  )
}
```

### Regular Expressions

Regular expressions are displayed with their pattern and flags:

```tsx
import { JsonTreeView } from '@ark-ui/solid/json-tree-view'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

const data = {
  regex: /^[a-z0-9]+/g,
  case_insensitive: /^(?:[a-z0-9]+)foo.*?/i,
}

export const Regex = () => {
  return (
    <JsonTreeView.Root data={data}>
      <JsonTreeView.Tree arrow={<ChevronRightIcon />} />
    </JsonTreeView.Root>
  )
}
```

### Error Objects

Error objects and their stack traces can be visualized:

```tsx
import { JsonTreeView } from '@ark-ui/solid/json-tree-view'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

const data = new Error('Error')

export const Errors = () => {
  return (
    <JsonTreeView.Root data={data}>
      <JsonTreeView.Tree arrow={<ChevronRightIcon />} />
    </JsonTreeView.Root>
  )
}
```

### Map and Set Objects

Native JavaScript Map and Set objects are supported:

```tsx
import { JsonTreeView } from '@ark-ui/solid/json-tree-view'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

const data = new Map<string, any>([
  ['name', 'ark-ui-json-tree'],
  ['license', 'MIT'],
  ['elements', new Set(['ark-ui', 123, false, true, null, undefined, 456n])],
  [
    'nested',
    new Map<string, any>([
      [
        'taglines',
        new Set([
          { name: 'ark-ui', feature: 'headless components' },
          { name: 'ark-ui', feature: 'framework agnostic' },
          { name: 'ark-ui', feature: 'accessible by default' },
        ]),
      ],
    ]),
  ],
])

export const MapAndSet = () => {
  return (
    <JsonTreeView.Root data={data}>
      <JsonTreeView.Tree arrow={<ChevronRightIcon />} />
    </JsonTreeView.Root>
  )
}
```

### Controlling Expand Level

Use the `defaultExpandedDepth` prop to control how many levels are expanded by default:

```tsx
import { JsonTreeView } from '@ark-ui/solid/json-tree-view'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

export const ExpandLevel = () => {
  return (
    <JsonTreeView.Root
      defaultExpandedDepth={1}
      data={{
        name: 'John Doe',
        age: 30,
        email: 'john.doe@example.com',
        tags: ['tag1', 'tag2', 'tag3'],
        address: {
          street: '123 Main St',
          city: 'Anytown',
          state: 'CA',
          zip: '12345',
        },
      }}
    >
      <JsonTreeView.Tree arrow={<ChevronRightIcon />} />
    </JsonTreeView.Root>
  )
}
```

### Custom Value Rendering

You can customize how specific values are rendered using the `renderValue` prop. This example shows how to make email
addresses clickable:

```tsx
import { JsonTreeView } from '@ark-ui/solid/json-tree-view'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

export const RenderValue = () => {
  return (
    <JsonTreeView.Root
      defaultExpandedDepth={2}
      data={{
        name: 'John Doe',
        age: 30,
        number: Number.NaN,
        email: 'john.doe@example.com',
        address: {
          street: '123 Main St',
          city: 'Anytown',
          state: 'CA',
          zip: '12345',
        },
      }}
    >
      <JsonTreeView.Tree
        arrow={<ChevronRightIcon />}
        renderValue={(node) => {
          if (node.type === 'text' && typeof node.value === 'string' && isEmail(node.value)) {
            return (
              <a href={`mailto:${node.value}`} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
                {node.value}
              </a>
            )
          }
        }}
      />
    </JsonTreeView.Root>
  )
}

const isEmail = (value: string) => {
  const strippedValue = value.replace(/^"(.*)"$/, '$1')
  return /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/.test(strippedValue)
}
```

### Configuration Options

The JSON tree view supports several configuration options to customize the display:

```tsx
<JsonTreeView.Root
  data={data}
  defaultExpandedDepth={2}
  quotesOnKeys={true}
  showNonenumerable={true}
  maxPreviewItems={5}
  collapseStringsAfterLength={50}
  groupArraysAfterLength={100}
>
  <JsonTreeView.Tree arrow={<ChevronRightIcon />} />
</JsonTreeView.Root>
```

**Configuration Options:**

- **`quotesOnKeys`**: Whether to show quotes around object keys
- **`showNonenumerable`**: Whether to show non-enumerable properties
- **`maxPreviewItems`**: Maximum number of items to show in object/array previews
- **`collapseStringsAfterLength`**: Collapse strings longer than this length
- **`groupArraysAfterLength`**: Group array items when array is longer than this length

### Using the Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the JSON tree view. It accepts the value of the `useJsonTreeView`
hook. You can leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the JSON tree view.

```tsx
import { JsonTreeView, useJsonTreeView } from '@ark-ui/solid/json-tree-view'
import { ChevronRightIcon } from 'lucide-solid'

export const RootProvider = () => {
  const jsonTreeView = useJsonTreeView({
    data: {
      name: 'John Doe',
      age: 30,
      email: 'john.doe@example.com',
      tags: ['tag1', 'tag2', 'tag3'],
      address: {
        street: '123 Main St',
        city: 'Anytown',
        state: 'CA',
        zip: '12345',
      },
    },
  })

  return (
    <JsonTreeView.RootProvider value={jsonTreeView}>
      <JsonTreeView.Tree arrow={<ChevronRightIcon />} />
    </JsonTreeView.RootProvider>
  )
}
```

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

## Accessibility

The JSON tree view is built on top of the Tree View component and complies with the
[Tree View WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/treeview/).

### Keyboard Support

**`Tab`**
Description: Moves focus to the tree view, placing the first tree view item in focus.

**`Enter + Space`**
Description: Selects the item or branch node

**`ArrowDown`**
Description: Moves focus to the next node

**`ArrowUp`**
Description: Moves focus to the previous node

**`ArrowRight`**
Description: When focus is on a closed branch node, opens the branch.<br> When focus is on an open branch node, moves focus to the first item node.

**`ArrowLeft`**
Description: When focus is on an open branch node, closes the node.<br> When focus is on an item or branch node, moves focus to its parent branch node.

**`Home`**
Description: Moves focus to first node without opening or closing a node.

**`End`**
Description: Moves focus to the last node that can be focused without expanding any nodes that are closed.

**`a-z + A-Z`**
Description: Focus moves to the next node with a name that starts with the typed character. The search logic ignores nodes that are descendants of closed branch.

**`*`**
Description: Expands all sibling nodes that are at the same depth as the focused node.

**`Shift + ArrowDown`**
Description: Moves focus to and toggles the selection state of the next node.

**`Shift + ArrowUp`**
Description: Moves focus to and toggles the selection state of the previous node.

**`Ctrl + A`**
Description: Selects all nodes in the tree. If all nodes are selected, unselects all nodes.


# Locale

## Setup

The `LocaleProvider` component sets the locale for your app, formatting dates, numbers, and other locale-specific data.

> **Note:** If no `LocaleProvider` is setup, the default locale for the app will be `en-US` and therefore the direction
> will be `ltr`.

```tsx
import { LocaleProvider } from '@ark-ui/solid/locale'

export const App = () => {
  return <LocaleProvider locale="de-DE">{/* Your App */}</LocaleProvider>
}
```

## Usage

To access the current locale and direction settings, use the `useLocaleContext` hook.

```tsx
import { useLocaleContext } from '@ark-ui/solid/locale'

export const Usage = () => {
  const locale = useLocaleContext()

  return <pre>{JSON.stringify(locale(), null, 2)}</pre>
}
```

## API Reference

### LocaleProvider

#### Props

**`locale`**
Type: `string`
Required: true
Default Value: `'en-US'`
Description: The locale to use for the application.


# Presence

## Examples

By default the child component starts out as hidden and remains hidden after the `present` state is toggled off. This is
useful for situations where the element needs to be hidden initially and continue to stay hidden after its presence is
no longer required.

```tsx
import { Presence } from '@ark-ui/solid/presence'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'

export const Basic = () => {
  const [present, setPresent] = createSignal(false)
  return (
    <>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => setPresent(!present())}>
        Toggle
      </button>
      <Presence present={present()}>Hidden and Hidden</Presence>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Lazy Mount

To delay the mounting of a child component until the `present` prop is set to true, use the `lazyMount` prop:

```tsx
import { Presence } from '@ark-ui/solid/presence'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'

export const LazyMount = () => {
  const [present, setPresent] = createSignal(false)
  return (
    <>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => setPresent(!present())}>
        Toggle
      </button>
      <Presence present={present()} lazyMount>
        Unmounted and Hidden
      </Presence>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Unmount on Exit

To remove the child component from the DOM when it's not present, use the `unmountOnExit` prop:

```tsx
import { Presence } from '@ark-ui/solid/presence'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'

export const UnmountOnExit = () => {
  const [present, setPresent] = createSignal(false)
  return (
    <>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => setPresent(!present())}>
        Toggle
      </button>
      <Presence present={present()} unmountOnExit>
        Hidden and Unmounted on Exit
      </Presence>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Combining Lazy Mount and Unmount on Exit

Both `lazyMount` and `unmountOnExit` can be combined for a component to be mounted only when it's present and to be
unmounted when it's no longer present:

```tsx
import { Presence } from '@ark-ui/solid/presence'
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'

export const LazyMountAndUnmountOnExit = () => {
  const [present, setPresent] = createSignal(false)
  return (
    <>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => setPresent(!present())}>
        Toggle
      </button>
      <Presence present={present()} lazyMount unmountOnExit>
        Lazy Mount and Unmounted on Exit
      </Presence>
    </>
  )
}
```
